# Every script, and what it does

<a id="tldrbluf"></a>

Find the script for your task, then open its linked reference. The recorded inventory had 39 scripts
on 2026-08-31 and moved off the landing page on 2026-08-16.

Paths are relative to the checkout. This site also serves them directly, including [/scripts/coord/claim.ps1](https://claude-multisession.pages.dev/scripts/coord/claim.ps1).

If you are deciding whether to install, start with [the FAQ](FAQ.md).

[Installed controls](#controls-that-run-without-you) run automatically. Other rows describe commands you run yourself, scheduled work, or
shared helpers.

---

You can also read the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/wshallwshall/korus).

For manual downloads, also fetch `ccx.config.json` and the seven shared modules listed under
[Internals and installers](#internals-and-installers).

Without those dependencies, the PowerShell scripts throw at the start of their bodies. The three
Python hooks exit 1 on import, while the worktree gate exits 0 and enforces nothing.

## Start here

| Script | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/ccx-doctor.ps1` | Prove -- by receipt and by attack -- that each control is installed, wired, and refuses what it can be made to refuse. It never infers, and a skip is never a pass (exit 2) | [Limits and requirements](LIMITS.md) |

## To run sessions

| Script | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/worktree/new.ps1` | Create an isolated worktree on its own branch, off the fetched remote tip, serialised against concurrent adds | [Worktrees](WORKTREES.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/spawn.ps1` | `new.ps1` plus an editor window (`-Editor`, else `CCX_EDITOR`, else `EDITOR`, else `code`) | [Worktrees](WORKTREES.md) |
| `scripts/coord/presence.ps1` | Who is live right now, across every surface. **Scoped to one repo by default**; `-Fleet` covers every repo the registry knows. Read-only | [Coordination](COORDINATION.md) |
| `scripts/coord/overlap.ps1` | What everyone else is changing -- files and stated work. `-File <path>`, `-Json`; cached, so the gate's common case is a cache read | [Coordination](COORDINATION.md) |
| `scripts/coord/claim.ps1` | Take, release or list an atomic claim on a piece of work, so a session finds out before the work rather than at merge. Advisory for free-text keys, enforced at `commit-msg` for numbered ones. Claims do not expire and releasing is manual, on purpose | [Coordination](COORDINATION.md) |
| `scripts/coord/alloc.ps1` | Allocate the next number in a shared sequence atomically, so two sessions can never be handed the same one; `-ShowFloor` inspects without spending one. `seq_check.py` is the other half -- neither is sufficient alone | [Sequence allocation](SEQUENCE-ALLOC.md) |
| `scripts/coord/mail.ps1` | Send, list or inspect the file-drop queue that reaches a peer in another Claude account or editor extension. `-Send -To <worktree path>` or `all`, `-List`, `-Status`. Queued is not delivered; the recipient's drain does that | [Session mail](SESSION-MAIL.md) |
| `scripts/coord/seat.ps1` | Write this session's episode record -- seat, goal, handoff -- so the next session is not guessing. `-Declare` also writes the role-card marker and refuses an unrostered seat; `-Record` never invents a goal | [Role cards](ROLE-CARDS.md) |
| `bin/ccx-steer.ps1` | Queue a steering note from a second terminal while a session is mid-task | [Steering](STEERING.md) |

## To clean up and recover

| Script | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/worktree/remove.ps1` | Remove one worktree, referencing its tip before anything is removed, and writing a keep-ref when `-DeleteBranch` is used | [Pruning](PRUNING.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/prune-merged.ps1` | The reaper: prune = merged **and** clean **and** unoccupied. Dry-run by default, `-Apply` to act. Carries a second, non-cwd signal and prints its blind spots | [Pruning](PRUNING.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/rescue.ps1` | Move uncommitted work out of the shared primary into a fresh worktree -- the companion to the gate that stops you writing there | [Worktrees](WORKTREES.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/restore-primary.ps1` | Re-attach the primary to its home branch after a session left it detached or on the wrong branch. Refuses on a dirty tree unless `-Force`, which carries the changes onto the home branch rather than discarding them | [Worktrees](WORKTREES.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1` | Find sessions for this repo across every login, including ones a relocation made invisible; `-Rehome` puts a transcript back | [Worktrees](WORKTREES.md) |

## Controls that run without you

Once installed, these controls run through client events or git hooks.

| Script | Event | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scripts/hooks/worktree_gate.ps1` | `PreToolUse` | Denies writes inside a governed primary, dispatch from it, the git verbs that swap or discard its tree, and those that hijack or remove another session's worktree. Fails open: loud on a load failure, silent on an empty allowlist | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/collision_gate.ps1` | `PreToolUse` | Refuses an edit to a file a live peer worktree has uncommitted changes in; your own worktree is skipped. Fails open and says so, but only once per reason per 30 minutes | [Coordination](COORDINATION.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/seat-declare.ps1` | `UserPromptSubmit` | A prompt that is EXACTLY a roster label declares that seat: writes the marker and loads the card in one turn. Anything less exact does nothing. Reads no ref. Always exits 0 | [Role cards](ROLE-CARDS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/announce-session.ps1` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Tells peers you exist and what you intend, on the first prompt at which a messageable peer exists. Always exits 0; delivery needs the desktop client | [Coordination](COORDINATION.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/session-context.ps1` | `SessionStart` | Banner: your project's working defaults plus a live coordination block. Its stdout is the chat's starting context, so it never fails loudly | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/worktree-selfheal.ps1` | `SessionStart` | Repairs a primary whose HEAD drifted, when the tree is clean -- the most privileged control here, whose only safety property is that it refuses a dirty tree | [Worktrees](WORKTREES.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/claim_check.py` | `commit-msg` | Refuses a code-touching commit whose subject claims an item this worktree does not hold. Fail-closed, but the installed hook is a shim that exits 0 when no python is on PATH | [Coordination](COORDINATION.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/push_guard.py` | `pre-push` | Refuses a direct push, or a deletion, of a protected ref. An explicitly empty `protectedRefs` list disables it on stderr. Same shim: no python on PATH and it exits 0 | [PRs and merges](PR-AND-MERGE.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/seq_check.py` | `pre-commit` | Refuses a colliding, unallocated, or unindexed sequence number; `--ci` re-runs the collision rules against a freshly fetched trunk. No installer wires it | [Sequence allocation](SEQUENCE-ALLOC.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/block-blanket-git-stage.ps1` | `PreToolUse` | Opt-in. Denies `git add -A/--all/-u/.` and `git commit -a/-am/--all`. Fails open | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/steer-inject.ps1` | `PreToolUse` | Opt-in per worktree. Delivers a queued steering note at the next tool-call boundary rather than at the end of the turn | [Steering](STEERING.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/role-card-inject.ps1` | `SessionStart` | Hand-wired. Injects this worktree's role card, resolved from `.claude/seat.local.txt` then `$env:KORUS_SEAT`. Never guesses from a branch or directory name -- it stays silent instead | [Role cards](ROLE-CARDS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/mail-drain.ps1` | `SessionStart`, `Stop` | Hand-wired, one script on two events. Renders this worktree's session mail at `SessionStart` and leaves it in the inbox; at `Stop` it consumes only what it displayed | [Session mail](SESSION-MAIL.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/precompact-reprime.ps1` | `PreCompact` | Hand-wired. Reads back what a compaction drops: the seat declaration on disk, and the allocations, claims and unpushed work this worktree holds. An unfiled allocation burns | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/block-api-burn.ps1` | `PreToolUse` | Hand-wired. Denies `gh run watch`, any `gh --watch`, and hand-rolled `gh` poll loops. Every seat spends one shared 5000/hr budget, and the seat that pays is not the seat that spent | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |

## Scheduled jobs

You must register this job with a scheduler. No installer schedules it, and no client or git event
triggers it.

| Script | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/cron/watch-ci-red.ps1` | Polls for pull requests your repository labelled red and starts one session per red to attribute it. Zero model calls; a quiet repository is free. Exits non-zero on a zero it cannot establish, or a dead seat. `-DryRun`, `-Json` | [Watching for a red](CI-RED-WATCH.md) |

## Gates you have to run yourself

No installer wires these checks. This repository runs them in `.github/workflows/gates.yml`; add
them to your own continuous integration workflow too.

| Script | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/security/scan_forbidden.py` | The leak gate: refuse identifying content before a private repo goes public. `--path DIR`, `--show-context`. With no token source it scans shapes only and still exits 0; `--require-tokens` refuses instead | [Leak gate](LEAK-GATE.md) |
| `scripts/quality/check-ascii.ps1` | The ASCII gate: names every non-ASCII character it finds, and `-Fix` rewrites the safe substitutions. The doctor reports it `OFF (opt-in)`, because nothing installs it | [House style](HOUSE-STYLE.md) |
| `scripts/quality/frozen_citations.py` | Which frozen `.old.md` archives cite a heading. Run it before you rename one: those links are hash-pinned, so they cannot be repaired. CI runs the test behind it, never this script | [House style](HOUSE-STYLE.md) |

## Instruments for a run

These instruments report detected failures. Before running the `scripts/validation/` checks, read
[what broken looks like](https://claude-multisession.pages.dev/scripts/validation/README.md) for
their failure criteria and the run's stopping point.

| Script | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/board/collect.py` | Reads the required contexts, the open pull requests with their checks, the merge queue and the create/merge/close timestamps for all three repositories into `data.json`. Refuses to write when a read fails. Needs `gh`; no standalone `jq` | [The Lander Board](LANDER-BOARD.md) |
| `scripts/board/series.py` | Derives the hourly merge and open-count series, the idle runs and the per-repository rates from `data.json` into `series.json` | [The Lander Board](LANDER-BOARD.md) |
| `scripts/board/build.py` | Renders `board.html` from `series.json` and `template.html`. Writes beside the scripts, or into `LANDER_BOARD_OUT` | [The Lander Board](LANDER-BOARD.md) |
| `scripts/validation/run-checks.ps1` | Proves every instrument against a planted broken corpus and a planted clean one, then runs the same checks against this machine. Exits 3 without measuring anything when a control misbehaves | [What broken looks like](https://claude-multisession.pages.dev/scripts/validation/README.md) |
| `scripts/validation/check-message-delivery.ps1` | Messages written against messages rendered. Fires when a message sat past the settle window with no receipt naming it | [Session mail](SESSION-MAIL.md) |
| `scripts/validation/check-message-expiry.ps1` | Receipts against deadlines. Fires when a message passed the ttl its sender set, unshown | [Session mail](SESSION-MAIL.md) |
| `scripts/validation/check-claim-holders.ps1` | Claim holders per item. Fires when two keys naming one item are held by two live worktrees, or one claim's worktree holds two live sessions | [Coordination](COORDINATION.md) |
| `scripts/validation/check-allocation-collisions.ps1` | Every ref, grouped by sequence number. Fires when one number maps to two paths its index row does not declare as companions | [Sequence allocation](SEQUENCE-ALLOC.md) |
| `scripts/validation/check-session-reaping.ps1` | Liveness against last write. Fires when a live record's worktree has seen no commit and no file write for a day | [Pruning](PRUNING.md) |
| `scripts/quality/expiry_audit.py` | Does the artifact a standing rule's expiry clause points at still exist? Reports DANGLING, UNCHECKABLE or LIVE per clause, and never decides a rule expired. Exits 0 unless `--strict` | [House style](HOUSE-STYLE.md) |

These instruments report results without blocking commits or pushes. CANNOT_TELL from a validation
check, and UNCHECKABLE from the expiry audit, mean nothing was examined. Neither means nothing was
wrong.

## Internals and installers

[Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) gives the four-installer order. [Install](INSTALL.md) explains the flags below.

| Script | Does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/coord/_common.ps1` | Config discovery, the state root, trunk resolution, path folding and git plumbing. Dot-sourced by nearly every PowerShell script here, never run on its own | [Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/_ccxconfig.py` | The Python counterpart, imported by all three git hooks. Copy a hook without it and that hook exits 1 on every commit | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/_command.ps1` | The one command splitter, dot-sourced by the worktree gate and the blanket-stage gate | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |
| `scripts/hooks/_gittarget.ps1` | Which repository a git command actually acts on. Dot-sourced by the worktree gate, and pulls in `_common.ps1` itself | [Hooks](HOOKS.md) |
| `scripts/coord/_mail.ps1` | Worktree root, mail root, hashed box key and delivery bounds for the mail lane. Dot-sourced by `mail.ps1`, `seat.ps1` and the drain, never run on its own | [Session mail](SESSION-MAIL.md) |
| `scripts/validation/_receipt.ps1` | The receipt shape and the one verdict rule every instrument reads: CLEAN, BROKEN, or CANNOT_TELL when nothing was examined. Dot-sourced by all five checks | [What broken looks like](https://claude-multisession.pages.dev/scripts/validation/README.md) |
| `scripts/validation/_mailbox.ps1` | The schema-tolerant mail-lane reader the two message checks share. It counts a file it cannot parse rather than dropping it, so a broken lane never reads as an empty one | [What broken looks like](https://claude-multisession.pages.dev/scripts/validation/README.md) |
| `scripts/site/publish_sources.py` | Copies everything `git ls-files` tracks into the built site, which is why the paths on this page resolve without a clone | [House style](HOUSE-STYLE.md) |
| `scripts/site/publish_revisions.py` | Validates archive hashes, publishes exact `.old.md` sources, and checks revision links and search exclusion after the Jekyll build | [House style](HOUSE-STYLE.md) |
| `scripts/site/plot_token_meter.py` | Rebuilds the token-meter chart from the published measurement table | [Token accounting](TOKEN-ACCOUNTING.md) |
| `scripts/site/build_redirect.py` | Builds the forwarding site for the old GitHub Pages address, a stub per old URL. It cannot help the reader the move was made for | [House style](HOUSE-STYLE.md) |
| `scripts/coord/session-registry.ps1` | The liveness fence: reads the client's session registry and decides whether a session is alive. Liveness may only VETO, never PERMIT -- DEAD/STALE/absent is the absence of a veto, not a permission | [Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) |
| `scripts/coord/occupancy.ps1` | The one cwd-to-worktree matcher, returning a receipt alongside its rows (roots examined, records examined, records that could not be placed) and setting `Available` only when there was something to examine | [Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) |
| `scripts/coord/lock.ps1` | The short-lived cross-session mutex, dot-sourced rather than run: `. lock.ps1` then `Enter-CcxLock` / `Exit-CcxLock`. No TTLs anywhere: locks retry and never steal, and on timeout fail loudly and name the holder | [Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) |
| `scripts/coord/install-coordination.ps1` | Wires the banner, collision gate and announce at user scope as shims that re-resolve at run time; writes exactly one settings file per run (`-SettingsPath`) | [Install](INSTALL.md) |
| `scripts/coord/install-git-hooks.ps1` | Installs `commit-msg` + `pre-push` into one clone's shared `.git/hooks` (`-RepoRoot`), refuses to overwrite a foreign hook, and never writes `pre-commit`. Both are `/bin/sh` shims that exit 0 when no python is found | [Install](INSTALL.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/install-gate.ps1` | Installs the worktree gate as a copy outside every working tree, into every config root it finds, plus the allowlist that is its kill switch (`-Repo`, `-ConfigDir`) | [Install](INSTALL.md) |
| `scripts/worktree/install-selfheal.ps1` | Wires the SessionStart backstop into ONE config root per run; `-ConfigDir` is mandatory, and it governs whatever the gate's allowlist already names | [Install](INSTALL.md) |
