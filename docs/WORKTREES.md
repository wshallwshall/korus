# Worktrees

## TLDR/BLUF

Give each concurrent session its own worktree. These commands create checkouts, rescue misplaced
work, restore the shared primary, and remove finished worktrees while preserving commit recovery.

A shared `git checkout` can replace another session's files without warning. These PowerShell 7
scripts target concurrent work and have been tested on Windows; test other platforms before relying
on them.

[Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) defines the terms. Use [Install](INSTALL.md) for the gate and backstop, and
[Pruning](PRUNING.md) for automatic cleanup.

---

Each agent or human needs a separate worktree to avoid branch changes replacing a peer's files.
Worktrees have separate directories, branches, and indexes, with shared git history and remotes.

The usual branch, pull request, and merge process stays the same.

## Command reference

Commands normally resolve the primary checkout from the first `git worktree list` entry. These three
have extra location rules:

- `prune-merged.ps1` refuses unless you run it from the primary, exiting 2 and naming both paths.
  From a linked worktree the candidate set is empty for the wrong reason.
- `remove.ps1` refuses when you are standing inside the worktree you named.
- `bin/ccx-doctor.ps1` does not anchor at all. With no `-Repo` it reports on your current directory,
  which is how a long green report about the wrong clone happens.

Five of the eight commands validate `-Name` with `\A[A-Za-z0-9._-]+\z`, since it becomes a
directory and branch name. `restore-primary.ps1`, `sessions.ps1`, and the doctor take no name.

`prune-merged.ps1` instead accepts an unvalidated name list. It limits the sweep to those worktrees
and explicitly overrides their recent-activity veto.

That override never bypasses liveness, nested-worktree exclusion, or a worktree lock. See
[Pruning](PRUNING.md).

Use `\A...\z` for full .NET string matching. `^...$` also accepts a trailing newline because `$`
matches before it.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Create a worktree on its own branch | `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/new.ps1 -Name <name>` |
| Create it and open an editor there | `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/spawn.ps1 -Name <name>` |
| Move uncommitted work out of the primary | `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/rescue.ps1 -Name <name>` |
| Put the primary back on its home branch | `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/restore-primary.ps1` |
| Remove one worktree | `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/remove.ps1 -Name <name>` |
| Remove the finished ones in bulk | `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/prune-merged.ps1` (dry run; `-Apply` acts) |
| Find sessions whose transcript moved | `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1` |
| Prove the guards are actually live | `pwsh -NoProfile -File bin/ccx-doctor.ps1` |

Repository-root `ccx.config.json` holds the command settings and enables announce.

The worktree gate and SessionStart backstop instead use `~/.claude/hooks/ccx-gate.repos.txt`. Apart
from the backstop's `prefix` setting, config does not control them; see
[Limits](LIMITS.md#what-actually-switches-each-control-on).

| Key | Effect on this document |
|---|---|
| `trunk` | The default `-Base` for a new worktree and the ref merged work is measured against. `auto` asks the remote what its default branch is. Overridable per session with `CCX_TRUNK`. |
| `worktreeLayout` | `sibling` (default) or `nested` -- see [Two layouts](#two-layouts-coexist-and-only-one-has-scripted-teardown). |
| `setupHook` | The per-checkout bootstrap `new.ps1` runs after creating a worktree. |
| `prefix` | The stem for the state root, the `<prefix>.homeBranch` git config key, and the `<prefix>-home-branch` sidecar record. |

---

## Creating a worktree

Create your checkout and branch from the current remote tip.

Run either command from any checkout of the repository:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/new.ps1 -Name alerts
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/new.ps1 -Name sqltuning -Base feature/sql-tuning
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/new.ps1 -Name quicklook -NoSetup
```

`new.ps1` fetches, creates the worktree, runs setup, and prints
`Worktree ready: <path> (branch '<branch>')` with next steps.

`spawn.ps1` forwards `-Name`, `-Base`, and `-NoSetup`, then opens an editor only after creation
succeeds. It reports an editor missing from `PATH`.

`-Editor` overrides `CCX_EDITOR`, then `EDITOR`, then default `code`.

### The base is the freshly fetched remote tip, not local `main`

Local `main` often lags upstream in a multi-worktree repository. Starting from it creates stale work
and stale merge judgments, including the reaper's check.

`new.ps1` fetches first and defaults to a remote-tracking ref such as `origin/main`. Two rules
govern that fetch:

- It fetches the remote the trunk lives on, parsed out of the base ref, rather than a hardcoded
  `origin`. A fork-based workflow whose trunk is `upstream/main` would otherwise fetch the wrong
  remote and report success.
- A fetch failure (offline) is a loud warning, not fatal. You can still branch off the refs you have
  -- you just need to know that is what happened.

An explicit local `-Base` that trails upstream triggers a warning with the branch, lag count, and
suggested remote ref. Remote-tracking refs lack `@{upstream}`, so the default skips this check.

### Concurrent creation races `.git/config.lock`

Concurrent `git worktree add` calls can fail with
`could not lock config file .git/config: File exists`, leaving an orphaned branch. Creation writes
upstream settings into shared `.git/config`.

`new.ps1` serializes creation with `Enter-CcxLock -Name 'worktree-add'` and a 90-second timeout. The
lock has three required properties:

- Atomic exclusive-create is the mutex. The lock is a file created with create-new semantics; the
  filesystem, not a read-then-write, decides who won.
- It never steals. On timeout it fails loudly and names the holder. Breaking a lock can admit
  simultaneous writers. No reliable liveness signal here proves that a lock is abandoned.
- The script refuses to run without it. If `scripts/coord/lock.ps1` is missing, or does not define
  `Enter-CcxLock`, `new.ps1` throws rather than racing quietly. A safety property that degrades to
  "not applied" when a file is missing is not a safety property.

### One dependency environment per worktree

A shared editable or linked dependency install points to its original source directory. Tests in
worktree B can import worktree A, passing locally while CI fails.

Build each worktree's dependency environment inside that worktree through `setupHook`. `new.ps1`
runs the language-specific hook and reports its result:

| Contract | Detail |
|---|---|
| Working directory | The **new** worktree. Relative paths resolve against it. |
| `CCX_WORKTREE_PATH` | Absolute path of the new worktree |
| `CCX_WORKTREE_NAME` | The `-Name` it was created with |
| `CCX_PRIMARY_ROOT` | Absolute path of the primary checkout |
| `CCX_BASE_REF` | The ref the branch was created from |
| Arguments | None are passed, so a hook may declare whatever parameters it likes |
| Exit code | A `.ps1` hook runs in a **child** `pwsh`, so its exit code is a real contract and it cannot leave state behind in the calling session |

`examples/worktree-setup.ps1.example` includes Python and Node examples. Copy the parts you need to
`setupHook` 's path, shipped as `.ccx/worktree-setup.ps1`, and follow these rules:

- Build the environment inside the worktree, for the reason above.
- Install from your lockfile, not from your version ranges. A worktree that re-resolves dependencies
  gets whatever the registry serves today -- a different formatter from CI. With a `--fix` mode in a
  commit hook, that formatter rewrites your source to match a version CI does not have.

Setup reports two distinct failures:

- The hook file is not found in the new worktree or the primary -> a warning that the worktree has
  *not* been set up. The worktree's versioned copy takes precedence. The primary copy supports
  git-ignored hooks that `git worktree add` cannot deliver.
- The hook exits non-zero -> a throw that states the worktree *was* created, at which path, on which
  branch, and is not rolled back. A bare "setup failed" reads as "nothing happened", and the next
  session re-runs creation into a path that is now occupied.

Use `-NoSetup` to create files without an environment. The printed next steps explicitly report that
setup has not run.

---

## Rescuing work already in the primary

Use `rescue.ps1` to move unfinished work out of the shared primary when the gate blocks further
edits.

Name the destination worktree:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/rescue.ps1 -Name alerts-fix
```

The script stashes primary changes, creates a worktree, and pops the stash there. Three details
preserve the work:

- `--include-untracked`. Without it, untracked files stay behind in the primary. The new worktree
  then recreates them: two diverging copies, with no indication which one you are editing.
- **The new branch is cut from the primary's *current* commit**, not from the trunk, so the stash
  applies cleanly. This is the one case where the fetched-remote-tip rule above is deliberately not
  applied -- a rescue that conflicts is a rescue that failed.
- The stash is the safety net, and the recovery path is printed at the moment of failure. If pop
  fails, `finally` prints commands to list and restore the stash. It also prints the original stash
  message. Mid-panic is not when someone opens a document.

If the primary is clean, the script reports nothing to rescue and suggests `new.ps1`. It creates no
empty worktree.

---

## What actually stops the failure

Three mechanisms address primary branch changes. Only the gate prevents them:

| Role | Script | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Prevention** | `scripts/hooks/worktree_gate.ps1` | Refuses the git verbs that would swap or discard the primary's tree, before the tool call runs. It reads command strings, so a script or a shell redirect is invisible to it, and it fails open |
| **Repair** | `scripts/worktree/worktree-selfheal.ps1` | Restores the primary when its HEAD has drifted and the tree is clean. On a dirty tree it declines and touches nothing |
| **Detection** | the home-branch record | Covers a **linked worktree** that drifted, not the primary -- so it does not see the failure above. Warn-only, and [wrong by design](#the-sidecar-home-branch-record-is-wrong-by-design) |

## Restoring the primary

`restore-primary.ps1` returns the shared primary to its home branch after a checkout or detached
HEAD replaced peers' files. The gate blocks ordinary tree-swapping git commands there.

A session may repair the primary but must not take it over.

Preview the switch with `-WhatIf`:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/restore-primary.ps1
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/restore-primary.ps1 -Branch main
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/restore-primary.ps1 -WhatIf
```

The script chooses the home branch in this order:

1. `-Branch`, for this run only
2. `git config <prefix>.homeBranch`
3. the local branch matching the configured trunk (`origin/main` -> `main` )
4. `main`, then `master`

Step 3 supports trunks with other names using the shared config source. It avoids maintaining a
second list of branch defaults.

`worktree-selfheal.ps1` lacks step 3. It tries the config key, then `main`, then `master`.

If a primary drifts from `develop` and `main` exists, the unattended backstop can wrongly switch it
to `main` at session start.

For a non-`main` trunk, save the home branch once so both scripts agree:

```powershell
git -C <primary> config <prefix>.homeBranch <your-trunk>
```

The script refuses a dirty primary and points to `rescue.ps1`. Switching could move or lose
someone's uncommitted work, and the script cannot identify its owner.

`-Force` skips the script's dirty check only. Its underlying `git checkout` uses neither `--force`
nor `-m`.

Git still refuses if modified tracked files differ across branches; neither path discards changes.
Use `rescue.ps1` to move that work first.

### The SessionStart backstop, and the half-failed auto-worktree

`install-selfheal.ps1` wires `worktree-selfheal.ps1` as an unattended `SessionStart` repair hook.

On Windows, automatic worktree creation can move the primary's `HEAD` to a session branch while
leaving an empty stub. See
[anthropics/claude-code#76590](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/76590).

The backstop handles each state as follows:

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| A governed primary has drifted off its home branch **and its tree is clean** | Switch it back, and **say so** in the session's context. A silent repair is indistinguishable from nothing having happened. |
| A governed primary has drifted **and its tree is dirty** | **Touch nothing, and say why.** Uncommitted work is never at risk from this hook -- but the decline is reported, not silent: the checkout stays on the wrong branch until a person commits, stashes or rescues that work, and a silent decline reads exactly like a primary that was fine. |
| A governed primary is on a **detached** HEAD, or has no resolvable home branch | Nothing, silently. Neither state says which branch it was meant to be on, and switching a shared checkout onto a guess is worse than leaving it. |
| This session's cwd is under `<primary>/.claude/worktrees/<name>` with **no `.git` there** | Report it as a ghost stub and tell the model to create a real worktree before editing. A real linked worktree has a `.git` **file** pointing at its private git directory; a half-failed stub has nothing there at all. That single test separates them. |
| This session's own linked worktree is on a different branch from its recorded home | **Warn only.** Never auto-switch a linked worktree under the session standing in it. |

The hook's only safety check is its dirty-tree refusal. The doctor requires a reasoned refusal on a
dirty, drifted fixture; a repair produces `RED`.

A clean fixture cannot prove that guard exists.

Every error path exits 0 silently. The installed hook is self-contained, duplicating
`scripts/coord/_common.ps1` rather than loading helpers from a working tree.

That keeps branch switches from removing its dependencies; a missing hook would also fail silently.

Both installers use the same fixed allowlist, `~/.claude/hooks/ccx-gate.repos.txt`. The backstop
and `PreToolUse` gate read it.

Earlier installers kept separate files: one rewrote its list, while the other only created a missing
copy. Changes did not propagate between them.

Uninstalling the gate could leave the backstop active and able to switch the shared primary.

Deleting the shared file disables both controls immediately, including in running sessions.

### The sidecar home-branch record is wrong by design

`new.ps1` records home in `<git-common-dir>/worktrees/<id>/<prefix>-home-branch`, inside that
worktree's private git directory. The drift detector reads it; branch changes cannot move it or
expose another worktree's value.

The record preserves the creation branch and never updates after intentional branch changes. The
detector must only warn; automatic repair could replace a live session's files.

During the audit, most live worktrees differed from their records. Creation and first-sighting
bootstrap both wrote records, but neither updated them.

The suggested repair would have moved sessions off their actual branches. Apply these rules:

- Prefer the authoritative source. `git worktree list --porcelain` needs no sidecar at all. Use the
  record only for the question it can answer.
- Treat a mismatch as a question, never a verdict. The hook warns and names both branches; the human
  decides.
- Never print a destructive remediation command from a detector you have not proven correct. The
  warning tells you to commit or stash first, and to run the switch yourself from a plain terminal.

When no record exists, the backstop records the worktree's current branch. That bootstrap can race
the harness's session setup.

If bootstrap runs before the harness switches branches, it records the pre-setup branch. Every later
start then repeats a stale mismatch warning.

Measured here on 2026-08-05: creation at 09:21:50, record at 09:21:54, and session-branch switch at
09:23:10. The record became stale after 76 seconds; no hijack occurred.

The record alone cannot distinguish setup from hijacking. Check the worktree reflog for a branch
change caused by an agent tool call before interpreting the warning.

`<prefix>.homeBranch` configures the primary's home for restore and selfheal. `<prefix>-home-branch`
records each worktree's creation branch.

Both derive their names from `prefix`, preventing separate renames from splitting the convention.

---

## Removing a worktree

Remove a finished worktree while preserving a route back to its commits.

Run from any checkout except the one you are removing:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/remove.ps1 -Name alerts
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/remove.ps1 -Name alerts -DeleteBranch
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/remove.ps1 -Name alerts -Force    # discard tracked changes too
```

The script prints the tip before deleting the worktree. With `-DeleteBranch`, it then asks git to
delete the branch using `-d`.

The script refuses if you stand inside the target worktree. Its message explains that location error
before git attempts removal.

Uncommitted tracked changes block removal unless you pass `-Force`. Untracked dependencies, build
output, and scratch databases do not block it.

**Removal deletes untracked files permanently.** Every path uses `git worktree remove --force`,
even without the script's `-Force` flag.

Inspect `.env`, databases, and scratch files before removal. Git never stored them, so neither
reflog nor `fsck` can recover them.

> The automatic reaper blocks on untracked files. Manual `remove.ps1` assumes you inspected those
> files and judged them disposable; keep this stricter rule for unattended cleanup.

### Reference the tip before anything is destroyed

Deleting a worktree and its branch can leave commits in no ref or reflog. The interface then offers
no evidence that the work existed.

Resolve and print the tip before deleting anything. With `-DeleteBranch`, save it in a keep-ref
before removing the branch:

```text
List them:    git for-each-ref refs/<prefix>/removed/
Recover one:  git branch <branch-that-was-deleted> refs/<prefix>/removed/<name>
Drop one:     git update-ref -d refs/<prefix>/removed/<name>
```

The keep-ref uses directory `-Name`, while deletion uses the worktree's actual branch. Recovery
must preserve that distinction.

`new.ps1 -Name my-task -Branch feature/my-task` gives them different names. Use the deleted branch
name printed by `remove.ps1` when restoring it.

The keep-ref preserves commit recovery past the next `gc`.

### `git branch -d` refusing is a signal

`git branch -d` may refuse work merged into remote trunk while local trunk lags. Using `-D` for that
reason bypasses git's protection against losing commits.

`remove.ps1` always uses `-d`. On refusal it preserves the branch, prints git's reason verbatim and
the tip again, then offers the forcing command.

It deletes the worktree's actual branch, not its directory `-Name`. Namespaced branches work with
`new.ps1 -Name my-task -Branch feature/my-task`, though directory names cannot contain `/`.

Deleting `my-task` in that example gives *branch not found*. The script now relays git's reason
instead of claiming the branch contains unique commits.

That old diagnosis sent users searching for nonexistent commits while the actual namespaced branch
remained after apparent cleanup.

A detached worktree has no branch to delete. The script reports that state without guessing from the
directory name.

### Never `git worktree prune` as cleanup

`remove.ps1` does not run `git worktree prune`. Prune can deregister worktrees on disconnected
drives, unmounted volumes, or temporarily missing nested paths.

`git worktree remove` already deregisters its own target.

Removal can also deregister a worktree before failing to delete its directory. Follow
[Pruning](PRUNING.md) to recover that leftover folder.

For bulk cleanup, `prune-merged.ps1` defaults to a dry run. It requires merged, clean, unoccupied
worktrees; occupancy may veto removal but never authorize it.

---

## Two layouts coexist, and only one has scripted teardown

Both sibling and nested worktrees were live together in the source project:

| Layout | Path | Created by | Torn down by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **sibling** (default) | `<parent-of-primary>/<primary-leaf>-<name>` | `new.ps1` / `spawn.ps1` / `rescue.ps1` | `remove.ps1`, `prune-merged.ps1` |
| **nested** | `<primary>/.claude/worktrees/<name>` | the harness itself -- and these scripts too, under `worktreeLayout: nested` | `remove.ps1` only, and only for one you named |

`worktreeLayout` selects where `new.ps1`, `spawn.ps1`, and `rescue.ps1` create worktrees. Setting
`nested` gives them the same layout the harness uses.

`Test-CcxHarnessWorktreePath` excludes `.claude/worktrees/` paths from the gate and reaper.
`remove.ps1` never calls it; under `nested`, `remove.ps1 -Name x` removes that named nested
worktree.

One helper handles two different requirements:

- A gate protecting the primary must *not* govern a nested worktree. Its path starts with primary,
  but its git commands change only its own tree. Governing it refused the most ordinary thing a
  session does.
- A reaper must *never* remove one. Some nested paths also start with `<primary>-`, misleading a
  sibling-prefix scan. Removing one can destroy a live session's checkout.

Two related path rules also apply:

- "Sibling" is not a prefix match. `<primary>-work/x` has the prefix but is no sibling.
  `Test-CcxSiblingWorktreePath` requires the same parent directory, a leaf of exactly
  `<primary-leaf>-<something>`, and not a harness worktree.

  Even then it only *looks* like ours: removal turns on occupancy, cleanliness and merge state.
- A nested checkout is git-ignored inside its parent. The parent therefore reads perfectly clean,
  and a `--force` removal of the parent deletes both -- leaving the nested worktree registered with
  no directory.

### A wrong-cwd run must refuse loudly, never green no-op

A sweep once ran from a linked worktree, found no siblings, and exited 0. The apparent all-clear hid
that it had searched from the wrong root.

Resolve primary through the first `git worktree list --porcelain` entry, as `Get-CcxPrimaryRoot`
does. Do not derive it from `$PSScriptRoot/../..`.

`prune-merged.ps1` now exits nonzero with
`REFUSED: this is a linked worktree, not the primary checkout` and names both paths.

`remove.ps1` likewise refuses when invoked inside its target.

`Get-CcxWorktreePath` in `scripts/coord/_common.ps1` owns the layout formula. Four scripts once
duplicated it and a fifth pattern-matched it, letting rules drift apart.

---

## What a worktree does *not* isolate

Worktrees separate files, branches, indexes, and setup-hook dependency environments. These five
resources still need shared rules:

| Shared thing | Why | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Coordination state** | It lives at `<git-common-dir>/<prefix>-coord`, which is identical across every worktree of a clone (that is the point -- a claim taken in one worktree must be visible in another). | Its corollary: **state outlives the worktree.** Remove a worktree and the claims it took are still there. Release on *evidence* -- the directory is gone **and** deregistered -- never on a timer. See [Coordination](COORDINATION.md). |
| **The git hooks directory** | One `commit-msg` / `pre-push` set lives in the shared git directory and governs every worktree of that clone at once. | Install once per clone, not per worktree. It also sees every write route, because it inspects the tree at commit time rather than a tool call. |
| **`.git/config`** | Written by `git worktree add`. | Already handled by the mutex above. |
| **The AI coding assistant's project memory** | It lives outside the repository, in one directory shared by every session on the machine. Last write wins. | Reads are fine. Coordinate **writes** explicitly, or let exactly one session own them. |
| **`.claude/` mostly does not reach a new worktree** | A project-scoped settings file is a creation-time snapshot at best, lives on one branch, and is commonly git-ignored. Anything *tracked* under `.claude/` is checked out like any other file; what is git-ignored cannot arrive at all. | Wire cross-session hooks at **user** scope, with the script installed outside every working tree. See [Install](INSTALL.md). |

Ports, development databases, Redis keyspaces, package caches, and git-ignored `.env` files also
remain outside these checks. See [Limits and requirements](LIMITS.md).

---

## Known limits

KORUS needs Claude Code for Desktop and vendored scripts in the governed repository.
[Limits and requirements](LIMITS.md) details those needs; these platform limits affect worktree
commands:

- PowerShell 7, Windows-first. Most scripts are `#Requires -Version 7.3` and were exercised on
  Windows. Since `$env:USERPROFILE` is Windows-only, home lookups fall back safely to the .NET
  accessor. Windows remains the tested platform.

  `worktree-selfheal.ps1` and its installer declare `-Version 7`, not 7.3. That is why 7.0-7.2 is
  worse than unsupported: the backstop installs there and the gates do not.
- Paths fold case on Windows and macOS, not on a case-sensitive filesystem. Use the folded form for
  comparison only, never for git, the filesystem, or a human. One silent gate failure on Linux CI: a
  lower-cased path went to `git -C`, git failed, and the rule fell through to allow.
- The harness's session record format is a vendor contract. The liveness fence behind the reaper
  reads per-session records the harness writes; that schema can change without notice. The fence
  then reports itself unavailable and nothing is pruned -- the intended failure direction, and an
  outage.
- Session listings do not see every session kind. Sessions relocated into a worktree file their
  transcript under a different key and drop out of the list of the window they were born in.
  `sessions.ps1` is how you find them, and `-Rehome` is how you put one back:

  ```powershell
  pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1                          # list
  pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1 -Id <id-prefix>          # one session
  pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1 -Rehome <id> -WhatIf     # preview the move
  pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1 -Rehome <id>             # move it back
  ```

  A bare invocation only ever lists. `-Rehome` is the one action that moves anything, and it honours
  `-WhatIf`.
- Nothing here can prove a session is gone. There is no heartbeat. Every occupancy verdict is the
  absence of a veto, not a permission.

Run `pwsh -NoProfile -File bin/ccx-doctor.ps1` to check which guards are installed and enforcing on
this machine.

The [shared-state map](CONCEPTS.md#g01) separates each worktree from the records the clone shares.
