# Tips and tricks

<a id="tldrbluf"></a>

Check that a tool measured the question you asked before trusting its result. These lessons came
from lost work, inactive controls, and misleading measurements during KORUS development.

Each entry records the incident or measurement behind it. The examples concern concurrent sessions;
they may be less useful before you have run them.

Find the entry that matches your problem. Most commands require `pwsh 7.3+`, were tested on Windows,
and assume Claude Code for Desktop.

---

KORUS was built and measured with Claude Code for Desktop. A command-line-only or editor-extension
setup is outside that tested scope; see [Limits](LIMITS.md).

- PowerShell 7 + Windows-first. Most of this repo is `pwsh`. The Python gates -- the git-hook
  checkers under `scripts/hooks/` and the leak gate at `scripts/security/scan_forbidden.py` -- are
  stdlib-only and portable; nearly everything else assumes `pwsh 7.3+`.
- Announcing needs Claude Desktop. `scripts/hooks/announce-session.ps1` resolves peers and asks
  the model to send, through `ccd_session_mgmt` -- an MCP server absent on a plain CLI install.
  Without it the hook fires, finds peers, then names tools the model lacks.
- Claude Code's session record schema is a vendor contract. The whole liveness fence rests on
  `<config-root>/sessions/<pid>.json` and its `pid` / `startedAt` / `sessionId` / `cwd` /
  `entrypoint` fields. It can change under you without notice.
- `list_sessions` cannot see every session kind. It enumerates only sessions the desktop app
  spawned. An editor-extension session is never registered there, so sharing the config root does
  not help. `scripts/coord/presence.ps1` reads the file registry, which covers every launch surface.

---

## 1. Read this first: Every failure here is green

Several failures produce the same visible result as a working control:

- A wired hook resolving nothing exits 0, like a healthy one with nothing to report.
- A missing gate script exits non-zero-but-not-2, and the tool call runs anyway.
- An empty peer list means "nobody is here" and "I could not look".
- A scanner that loaded zero rules exits 0, like one that found none.

In a fresh clone, audit the controls before installing or trusting them.

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File bin/ccx-doctor.ps1 -Repo <the-repo-you-governed>
```

The audit prints what it scanned and performs four checks:

- it hashes every installed copy against this checkout's source;
- it reads every config root's live matchers;
- it **fires each control and requires a deny**, pairing each attack with a negative control the
  guard must *allow*;
- it **names its own blind spots**, on every run, pass or fail.

Read `repo examined` before the verdict. Without `-Repo`, the command audits the repository
containing your current directory.

Running in the tooling checkout can produce a plausible report about the wrong repository.

The report uses these result tags:

| Tag | Meaning | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| `OK` | Proven: installed, wired, and it refused what it must refuse | 0 |
| `RED` | Proven broken: stale, unloadable, allowed a deny case, or denied an allow case | 1 |
| `OFF` | Implemented, but nothing invokes it -- zero enforcement | 1 (unless opt-in by design) |
| `??` | Could not be determined | 2 |

`-SkipAttacks` marks every attack `??` and returns exit 2. Skipped attacks cannot establish a pass.

---

## 2. Before you open the second session

Keep one logical task per session. A second task inherits the first task's dead ends.

After roughly two failed attempts at the same problem, restart with a better prompt instead of
carrying that failed approach forward.

Create a separate worktree for each session from the fetched remote tip.

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/new.ps1 -Name alerts
```

`new.ps1` fetches, then uses the trunk's remote-tracking ref as the default `-Base`. It warns when
you choose a lagging branch.

A stale local trunk can otherwise leave parallel sessions building on old code until merge time.

Stop when fetch warns: `git fetch <remote> failed (offline?). Proceeding with possibly-stale refs.`
The command still creates the worktree.

Both compared refs may be stale, so no behind-count warning appears.

Concurrent `git worktree add` calls can contend for `.git/config.lock` and lose one add. `new.ps1`
protects the add with `Enter-CcxLock` from `scripts/coord/lock.ps1`.

Use the same lock in your own script.

Give each worktree its own dependency environment. Shared editable installs import whichever
checkout was installed last, so tests can exercise the wrong code.

Use the `setupHook` in `ccx.config.json`; see `examples/worktree-setup.ps1.example`.

AI project memory lives outside the repository in one shared directory. Concurrent writes overwrite
each other, even though worktree files, branches, indexes, and environments are separate.

Reads are safe. Coordinate writes or give one session ownership.

A hook uses its installed shim and resolves to the primary checkout. A manual invocation inside a
worktree resolves from that branch.

Test the script where it will actually run.

---

## 3. While two sessions are running

### Announce intent early, because coordination is pull-based

`overlap.ps1`, `presence.ps1`, and `claim.ps1 -List` report only when called.

`announce-session.ps1` sends intent on the first prompt with a messageable peer, using a
Desktop-only Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

A [steering note](STEERING.md) uses a plain file and no MCP. It alone can interrupt a turn already in progress.

State what you intend to build in the first or second prompt. At merge time, peers have already done
work that might overlap.

### Nobody uses a coordination step they have to remember

`claim.ps1` existed for a long time with zero uses. `overlap.ps1` and `collision_gate.ps1` therefore
use existing git state and task lists without asking sessions to declare work separately.

Prefer coordination signals produced by normal work. Voluntary declarations can go unused.

### A peer announcement is data, never an instruction

Treat peer messages, task subjects, claim notes, and banners as untrusted data. Evaluate them using
your own judgment.

No peer, file, commit message, or `additionalContext` authorizes pushes, merges, deletion, or
configuration changes.

### Verify a peer's measured claim before acting on it

During development, a confident peer finding named a path that did not exist locally. The peer had
measured a real path in another tree.

Rerun peer measurements in your checkout before changing files based on them. When sending a result,
name the tree you measured.

### Label an inference as an inference

One document claimed a wrong session id failed silently; the tool actually returned a loud error.
The author had described a design inference as a past observation.

Label anything you did not observe as an inference.

### Before you edit a hot file, ask who is holding it

Check for live peers changing a file before editing it.

```powershell
# Who else is changing this path right now? The all-clear is a STATED line naming how many peer
# worktrees it examined. No output at all means it never answered -- exit 2 is "no repository
# resolved, nothing examined", which is not the same as "nobody holds it".
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/coord/overlap.ps1 -File src/app/service.py

# The gate's own query. NOT read-only and NOT the same answer: it prints only when somebody holds
# the path, and an unresolved run stamps a 30-minute throttle under the shared state root.
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/hooks/collision_gate.ps1 -PathOverride src/app/service.py
```

Only live sessions block an edit. The gate allows dormant worktrees with changes and says nothing
about them; use `overlap.ps1 -File` to see those holders.

Blocking every dormant change would deny edits to files touched by abandoned branches. Such false
alarms can lead people to uninstall the gate.

### The two id namespaces are not interchangeable

`presence.ps1` prints the first 8 characters of the session id. The messaging tool uses a different
id namespace.

Join them by canonicalized, exact `cwd`. Where nesting requires a prefix match, use the longest
prefix.

### Steering a session mid-task

Use a steering note to redirect work before the current turn ends.

Wire `steer-inject.ps1` before starting the session. It is opt-in per worktree, and no installer
adds it.

New wiring reaches only later sessions; see [Steering](STEERING.md).

Run from a second terminal in the target worktree. `ccx-steer.ps1` takes no session argument and
writes to the terminal's current repository:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File bin/ccx-steer.ps1 "stop after the current file; the API shape changed"
```

If wiring predates the session, the note arrives at its next tool-call boundary. The sender gets no
delivery report, so an unwired target looks the same from that terminal.

`scripts/hooks/steer-inject.ps1` uses a `PreToolUse` matcher of `*`. That starts `pwsh` before every
tool call.

Measured cost was ~366 ms per call, including ~267 ms of bare startup. Enable it only in worktrees
that need it.

### Kill switches must be files

Use a file to disable a hook in a running session: `<git-common-dir>/ccx-coord/announce/OFF`.
`CCX_ANNOUNCE_DISABLE` affects sessions not yet started.

Deleting `~/.claude/hooks/ccx-gate.repos.txt` disables the worktree gate.

### Commit at logical stops; keep pushes gated

Commit at tested, logical stops so rescue has usable history. Ask before pushes, pull requests, and
merges; auto-merge can put a pull request on trunk.

`scripts/hooks/push_guard.py` blocks direct pushes to `protectedRefs` locally. It installs per clone
and remains advisory because `--no-verify` skips it.

---

## 4. When you write a guardrail

A guardrail's failure posture says what happens when the check breaks. Fail-open lets work continue;
fail-closed stops it.

State the posture and reason at the top of the file. `collision_gate.ps1` fails open to avoid
blocking work; `worktree_gate.ps1` fails open with a notice.

`claim_check.py` fails closed in two places because a false clean result is unrecoverable.

Error paths in `collision_gate.ps1` once returned exit 0 without output, just like an all-clear.
Failed resolution now reports through `additionalContext`; it still allows the work.

In `presence.ps1`, `@() | ConvertTo-Json -AsArray` sends no objects, so the converter never runs.
The branch printed nothing where another printed `[]`.

Emit an empty array explicitly. Put failure-to-inspect notices on stderr.

Always include the `hookSpecificOutput` wrapper. The client silently ignores a bare
`permissionDecision`, leaving every tool call permitted.

Gate the destination path. Over 30 days, 29% of Edit/Write calls from primary-seated sessions
targeted sibling worktrees through absolute paths.

A working-directory rule would wrongly deny those valid writes.

The same 29% also escapes an occupancy check based only on recorded working directories. Such checks
cannot see sessions writing into another tree.

`prune-merged.ps1` therefore requires two independent occupancy signals. Recent git-metadata
modification time supplies the stronger signal.

False denials encourage bypasses. `block-blanket-git-stage.ps1` deliberately allows `--amend` but
denies a single-dash flag cluster containing `a`.

Tool-name lists miss every unlisted route in both matcher and rule body. A dispatch ban covering
three tool names left four other routes probe-verified ALLOW.

Document the list and its limits.

A command-string gate cannot see commands inside an agent-written script. `PreToolUse` sees the
invocation arguments.

The hooks from `scripts/coord/install-git-hooks.ps1` inspect the tree at commit time. Shared
`.git/hooks` covers every worktree and write route.

Protect hook configuration separately. Linked worktrees share config as well as objects, so one
change to hook resolution can disable commit-time checks everywhere.

A verb gate without `config` coverage leaves that route open.

Use `Resolve-CcxGitTarget` from `scripts/hooks/_gittarget.ps1` and `Split-CcxCommand` from
`scripts/hooks/_command.ps1`.

Separate parsers for `-C`, `cd`, and working directory can each assume another rule covers the same
case.

Keep one implementation of each safety check. Both read-only `presence.ps1` and destructive
`prune-merged.ps1` use `Get-WorktreeOccupancy` from `scripts/coord/occupancy.ps1`.

Use one allowlist path for every consumer. With two paths, uninstalling the gate once left its
backup check able to run `git checkout` on the primary.

Give installers the same session refusal, discovery, `-Status`, and `-Uninstall` behavior. Test that
they reach the same directories.

`install-gate.ps1 -NoDispatchGate` disables an implemented rule. The installer warns, and `-Status`
reports its tools as UNWIRED so the disabled check remains visible.

Allocate claims, numbers, and locks by exclusive file creation. A failed create establishes that
another process owns it.

A read-modify-write operation on one shared list silently lost 4 of 8 concurrent writes here.

Do not expire locks on timers. Expiry can admit a second process while the first still holds the
critical section.

`lock.ps1` retries without stealing. A timeout fails loudly and names the holder.

Liveness may only VETO, never PERMIT. With no heartbeat, the system cannot prove a session is gone.

DEAD, STALE, or absent means no veto, not permission.

Log every denial. One gate once printed decisions and exited 0 without retaining a log, counter, or
audit file. Nobody could answer:

- how many drift events did this prevent?
- is the false-positive rate one a day, or one in a thousand?
- did that fix change anything?

Without those records, severity rankings were opinions. `worktree_gate.ps1` now records timestamp,
rule, tool, working directory, and rule-composed detail.

It excludes raw commands and file contents so secrets in arguments cannot enter the plaintext log.

Test denial text as well as decisions. One denial listed the forbidden primary first among suggested
worktrees, displacing a valid suggestion beyond the display cap.

A string-to-object comparison made its filter always pass, and no test checked the message.

`overlap.ps1` and `collision_gate.ps1` share a named row contract recorded in both files. Adding
fields is allowed.

Renaming a field or changing its meaning requires updating both notes in one commit. Otherwise, the
meaning can change without an error.

Use one numbering scheme for a rule set. If prose and code assign different meanings to "rule 3", a
later edit can update one and silently leave the other.

## 5. When you measure whether it works

Each measurement trap below occurred while building this repository, despite a check reporting
success.

Before trusting a result:

> **Name the question. Name what the tool actually returns. Check that they are the same
> sentence.**

### `$?` after a pipe reads the last command

A leak scan refused the tree, but its wrapper printed `exit=0`. `$?` held `tail`'s status from the
last pipeline command.

<!-- no-copy -->
```bash
# WRONG - $? is tail's
scan ./tree | tail -5
echo "exit=$?"

# Right - read the producer's status, or do not pipe
scan ./tree > scan.out; rc=$?
tail -5 scan.out
echo "exit=$rc"

# Or, in bash:
scan ./tree | tail -5
echo "exit=${PIPESTATUS[0]}"
```

PowerShell's `$?` and `$LASTEXITCODE` report different results; only native commands set
`$LASTEXITCODE`.

Several scripts set `$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference = $false` to keep non-zero `git`
results inspectable instead of throwing.

### `printf` mangles Windows paths

A fixture was meant to contain `C:\Users\<name>\...`. `printf` treated `\U` as a Unicode escape and
changed it.

The scanner could not find the intended violation because the file never contained it.

<!-- no-copy -->
```bash
# WRONG - \U, \n, \t all get interpreted
printf 'C:\Users\someone\project\file.txt' > fixture.txt

# Right - quoted heredoc, then print the file back and LOOK at it
cat <<'EOF' > fixture.txt
C:\Users\someone\project\file.txt
EOF
cat fixture.txt
```

Always read the fixture back before trusting a test that depends on its exact bytes.

### A scanner handed a file argument can be a silent no-op

A scanner once accepted a file argument, dropped it, and exited 0. A mixed file-and-directory run
also passed because its refusal required every input to be dropped.

The scanner now reads file arguments and returns 2 when an argument yields zero files. Check its
input counts even when another input scanned successfully.

### A green gate is evidence only if you proved it can see that class

Plant a known violation and require failure before trusting a pass. A clean result alone cannot
prove the detector ran.

Check that detector and rule counts are non-zero. `ccx-doctor.ps1` also pairs attacks with ordinary
inputs that must pass.

Those controls distinguish working enforcement from a script that refuses everything.

A broken probe can also misreport a working gate. [Establishing what a hook actually does](HOOKS.md#establishing-what-a-hook-actually-does) records that case and its four resulting
rules.

On 2026-08-11, a grep for three tokens returned zero on a ref without a classifier. The same search
also returned zero on a ref that had to match.

The conclusion was true, but the check supplied no evidence. Always run the search against a known
positive before trusting a zero.

### A gate cannot see a policy judgment

A scanner cannot judge whether ordinary prose belongs in a repository. Assign that decision to a
human reading the diff; do not assume a pattern can make it.

### Build artifacts contaminate a scan

A username scan failed on clean source because `__pycache__/*.pyc` embedded source paths.
`.gitignore` covers `__pycache__/` and `*.py[cod]`, but a disk scan still sees them.

Use `git ls-files` when checking what will be published. For a disk inventory, include build
artifacts and say that the scan covers them.

### An over-matching glob turns a passing check into a fake failure

An overly broad glob sent Markdown to a PowerShell parser. Its syntax error was valid for
PowerShell, but the file was valid Markdown.

Twenty minutes went into investigating the wrong file.

Print the input file list before checking it. That makes a wrong scan scope visible.

### A missing tool returns nothing, and nothing reads as zero

Two "0 hits" reports came from a missing `bc` command. Empty output was compared as zero.

Check that required tools exist. Treat an empty result as an error, not zero.

### Test the installed copy, not the repository copy

A gate had 85 green tests against its repository copy. Enforcement used a stale installed copy, so
the tests proved nothing about the live gate.

Feed crafted JSON to the installed file the client invokes. `install-git-hooks.ps1 -Status` compares
hashes with the receipt and current sources.

Installing from a stale checkout can downgrade the gate for every worktree.

### Merging a hook does not install one

Merging changes neither `~/.claude/settings.json` nor `~/.claude/hooks/`. Gitignored project
settings also fail to reach new worktrees.

Measured here, over half the worktrees lacked project settings. One live session had zero
coordination context.

Check an installation receipt and a freshly resolved target. A settings entry alone only claims the
hook exists.

`install-coordination.ps1 -Status` reads its receipt and resolves every shim target again.

### An installer with no row for a hook is a hook that runs nowhere

On 2026-08-11, a documented watcher passed client checks but had no row in
`install-coordination.ps1`. It had never been enabled anywhere.

Source, tests, and docs all showed the hook existed. None recorded an installation.

### Put at least one signal outside the component being audited

A hook printed status and exited 0 for weeks while resolving nothing. Its receipts lived inside a
script the shim could not find.

Every check depended on reaching that missing script.

Put a signal where it can still report if the control fails to load.

### Prove each fix catches its own regression

Mutate each fix and require its test to fail. A test that passes both versions does not detect the
repaired defect.

### Re-measure a premise before you defend it

A deny rule rested on three claims. Remeasuring confirmed the first and found the second already
covered elsewhere.

The third, which justified a hard denial, was one undocumented observation that did not reproduce.

Mark figures you cite without remeasuring them. Present-tense wording can make an old measurement
look fresh.

### Reconcile the parts against the total the tool already printed

Eight reported section counts added to 1202. The same output said `found 646 section citations`,
making the inconsistency visible without another run.

Each row printed a section twice: in a field and in the quoted citation. A pattern missing its
trailing-space anchor counted both, doubling every figure.

A reader caught the mismatch in a chat message without access to the terminal. Comparing the output
with itself needed no second tool.

### Two instruments, one answer

On 2026-08-12, two methods found 61 citations for one section. One renumbered it and counted
failures; the other tallied the tool's listing.

The mutation method did not reuse the counting pattern.

Agreement between independent methods supported 61. The 1202 result had no cross-check.

Name the corpus and commit beside a total. The tool found 646 on one branch and 653 on another with
two new citing files; both counts were correct.

### Measure adherence, do not assume a reminder works

A `SessionStart` banner told sessions to use worktrees. Over 30 days, 44% of writes from
primary-seated sessions still landed in the primary.

Enforce important conventions mechanically and measure their results.

The counts and the denominator are in the [README](https://claude-multisession.pages.dev/README.md), which is the record for this figure.

On 2026-08-12, two sessions failed to consult a written rule four times. One broke a
glyph-vocabulary ban in the protected file while an audit was measuring that rule.

### A green CI run is not evidence of the thing you gated

CI can check a numbered file without checking that its number was allocated. Docs-only filters can
also skip the very job meant to protect docs.

Confirm the needed job ran for your change class.

### State status exactly

Name unfinished work in the status sentence: *"Done, except Z, which is not started."* Without the
exception, a known gap can disappear from the next session's view.

### A bare threshold is not a decision

A threshold needs context before it can guide a decision.

7% remaining can be enough with 7 minutes until reset, but scarce with four hours left. A peer
paused everyone on the percentage alone.

After checking the clock, they retracted: *"The priority was right for a different reason than the
one I gave."*

Check both the reading's limits and the input that determines the action:

- Pair the reading with whatever bounds it -- a time-to-reset, a rate, a denominator. A figure
  with no bound cannot answer a "should I act" question.
- Say which input drove the decision. "We are at 93%" and "the window resets in 9 minutes" are
  both true and lead to opposite actions. A recommendation that does not name its deciding input
  cannot be checked, or corrected, by the next reader.

Test counts need causes, coverage percentages need scope, and queue depth needs a clearing rate.
[USAGE-AWARENESS.md](USAGE-AWARENESS.md) also explains why account identity must accompany a budget percentage.

## 6. Platform and parser traps

| Trap | What actually happens | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `-match` is case-**insensitive** in PowerShell | A rule parsing git's `-C <path>` captured git's lowercase global `-c name=value` as a directory, and allowed the command | Use `-cmatch` for anything parsing flags. When you harden one rule, sweep every sibling parsing the same syntax |
| A parameter default that throws kills the hook before line 1 | `$env:USERPROFILE` is null off Windows, so `Join-Path` throws during **binding** -- and a hook exiting non-zero-but-not-2 lets the tool call through silently | Resolve null-safely; add a test that runs the script with **no arguments**, because a default is never evaluated when a value is supplied |
| `(` opens a command-invocation group | `Join-Path ( if (...) {...} ) ...` fails with "the term 'if' is not recognized" | A statement needs `$( ... )`, a subexpression |
| `ConvertFrom-Json` coerces ISO-8601 into `[datetime]` | `[string]$obj.claimed` gives you the local short form, silently losing sub-second precision and the UTC offset on every round trip | Round-trip through the raw string, and test the round trip |
| Comparing a string to an object is always true | A filter meant to exclude the primary excluded nothing | Compare like to like; assert on the filtered output, not on the filter |
| `cd ../../..` is how a nested worktree names its parent | Every git verb aimed at the primary that way walked past two separate rules, each assuming the other owned the case | One shared target resolver: `-C` case-sensitively, then `cd`/`pushd`, then cwd, canonicalised |
| A CRLF or a BOM breaks a hash comparison | Controls here compare installed copies against repo copies by SHA-256; line endings are part of their correctness | UTF-8 **no BOM**, LF everywhere -- see `.editorconfig` |
| `ps -e` is not `ps -A` on every platform | On some BSD-derived platforms `-e` means "show the environment too" | `ps -A -o pid=,ppid=` with empty headers, so there is no header row to skip |

### Keep it ASCII -- there are no exceptions

Keep every file pure ASCII. Use `--`, `->`, `...`, `"`, and `'` instead of extended punctuation or
symbols.

These failures occurred during development:

- A non-ASCII character inside a string a script prints raises on a cp1252 console:
  `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters`. cp1252 is the Windows default this
  tooling targets. The failure lands in the *reporting* path, so the tool dies while telling you
  something.
- A scanner's own diagnostic output was observed rendering as replacement characters
  mid-sentence. The finding was produced correctly and was unreadable.
- Reading a file without an explicit `encoding=` raises on one host and silently substitutes
  replacement characters on another. Same code, same bytes, different machine, different
  behavior. The machine that substitutes is the one that loses data quietly.
- Emoji and box-drawing characters are not one column wide, so fixed-width tables and receipts
  stop lining up. There is no correct width to target, either: terminals, diff viewers and pagers
  disagree with each other about everything past ASCII.
- **A stray character can arrive from a *prompt* and survive review**, because it is visually
  indistinguishable from its ASCII neighbour. One did, in this build.

Apply ASCII-only without exceptions. Exceptions such as "only in Markdown" require a reader to judge
each character, including ones they cannot distinguish visually.

The script enforces the rule.

Scan for non-ASCII bytes and apply substitutions that preserve meaning.

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/quality/check-ascii.ps1          # report
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/quality/check-ascii.ps1 -Fix     # rewrite the safe substitutions
```

The report gives `file:line:column`, a `U+XXXX` code point, its name, and a suggested ASCII
replacement.

A curated table names familiar characters. Others receive their Unicode block and general category,
with an explicit note that no description is available.

`-Fix` handles dashes, arrows, ellipses, curly quotes, non-breaking and zero-width spaces, bullets,
multiplication signs, and section signs. These substitutions preserve meaning.

Accented letters, emoji, box drawing, and other symbols remain unchanged. The tool reports them for
a person to resolve.

The checker also verifies its own reporting and scope:

- It never prints the offending character, only `U+XXXX` and a name. Echoing it would
  reintroduce the exact cp1252 failure the check exists to catch, and a scanner that dies while
  reporting a violation reports nothing.
- It always prints what it scanned -- file count and byte count -- and a run that scanned
  nothing exits **2**, never 0. A mistyped path in CI produces precisely the shape of a clean run.
- `ccx-doctor.ps1` attacks it every run. It plants an em dash and requires a non-zero exit and
  `U+2014`: a bare non-zero exit means an unreadable file. A clean file must pass, and an empty
  directory must answer 2. A checker exiting 0 turns two of the three RED; exiting 1 turns all
  three.

Add the check to your own `pre-commit` hook and CI. No installer wires it, so otherwise it sees only
manually selected files.

---

## 7. Cleanup and teardown

`prune = merged AND clean AND NOT occupied`. A newly created worktree is already clean and an
ancestor of trunk, even with a live session.

One occupied worktree was destroyed because cleanup checked only branch state.

Skip whenever a check cannot determine safety. An unnecessary skip delays cleanup; a mistaken prune
destroys a session.

Never run `git worktree prune`. It deregisters any temporarily missing worktree, including nested
client-managed trees, and can finish damage left by a failed removal.

`git worktree remove --force` can deregister a tree it fails to delete. Git then fails inside that
tree, but `git worktree list` no longer shows it.

`prune-merged.ps1` records these orphans in `prune-merged-orphans.json` and reports them again on
later runs.

A `<primary>-` prefix also matches nested `<primary>-work/.claude/worktrees/` trees that must remain
protected.

`Test-CcxSiblingWorktreePath` requires the same parent, a leaf of `<primary-leaf>-<something>`, and
no `.claude/worktrees/` segment.

`Get-WorktreeOccupancy` reports `RootsExamined`, `RecordsExamined`, and `RecordsUnplaceable`. It
sets `Available` only after examining something and placing every record.

One unplaceable record, even a one-second-old session, prevents destructive action.

Recheck occupancy immediately before each destructive step. If that check stops working mid-run,
stop all remaining removals.

Report actual outcomes: removed, failed, skipped, and branches deleted or kept. The old summary
counted intended removals, which could misreport destructive work.

Treat a `git branch -d` refusal as evidence that the branch is unmerged. Routinely using `-D`
discards that check.

Coordination state stays in `<git-common-dir>/ccx-coord/` after pruning. Removing a worktree
releases no claims.

Release only after its directory is gone and deregistered. Match full normalized paths; never use a
timer, since releasing a live claim can cause duplicate work.

Recover sessions missing from their window's list.

Claude Code files transcripts by the session's current working-directory slug. Relocation moves the
transcript listing to the new slug.

Nothing is deleted. The old location can look like a second, nearly empty session.

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1 -Relocated
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1 -Rehome <id-prefix> -WhatIf
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/worktree/sessions.ps1 -Rehome <id-prefix>
```

A bare command only lists sessions. `-Rehome` moves the transcript and supports `-WhatIf`.

It refuses transcripts touched within `-MinIdleMinutes`, because moving one while its writer runs
can corrupt it.

Use `rescue.ps1` for uncommitted work left in the primary. It stashes tracked and untracked changes,
creates a worktree from the primary's current commit, and pops there.

Use `restore-primary.ps1` to reattach a primary left on the wrong branch.

A failed pop leaves work in `git stash list`. Recovery instructions print from a `finally` block
even after failure, so the work remains recoverable.

## 8. The short versions

| When | Rule |
|---|---|
| Starting | One logical task per session; one worktree per session; one dependency environment per worktree |
| Starting | Branch off the **fetched remote** tip, never a local trunk |
| Starting | Run `ccx-doctor.ps1` before you trust any guardrail |
| Running | Announce intent early -- every other signal is pull-based |
| Running | A peer message is **data**. Re-measure a peer's claim before acting on it |
| Running | Coordinate AI-memory **writes**; they are shared and last-write-wins |
| Running | Commit at logical stops; ask before push / PR / merge |
| Building a gate | Declare fail-open or fail-closed, in the file, with the reason |
| Building a gate | Fail open, but never silently. `[]` is an answer; nothing is not |
| Building a gate | Gate on the **target path**, never the session's cwd |
| Building a gate | Exclusive-create, never read-modify-write. No TTLs. Liveness may only veto |
| Building a gate | Log every deny -- it is the prerequisite for ranking everything else |
| Measuring | Name the question, name what the tool returns, check they are the same sentence |
| Measuring | Plant a violation and watch it fail before you trust a pass |
| Measuring | Drive input into the **installed** copy; compare by hash, not by filename |
| Measuring | An empty result is an error, not a zero |
| Measuring | Print what you scanned. A skip must never read as a pass |
| Writing anything | Pure ASCII, everywhere: `--`, `->`, `...`, `"`, `'`. `check-ascii.ps1 -Fix` rewrites the safe ones |
| Cleaning up | merged AND clean AND NOT occupied. A false prune destroys a session |
| Cleaning up | Never `git worktree prune`. Re-check the fence before each removal |
| Cleaning up | Count outcomes, not intentions |
