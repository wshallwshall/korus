.SYNOPSIS
    Which worktree is each live session sitting in -- the shared occupancy matcher.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source this; it defines functions and does nothing on its own.

        . "$PSScriptRoot/occupancy.ps1"
        $occ = Get-WorktreeOccupancy -Repo $RepoRoot -ConfigRoot $ConfigRoot
        if (-not $occ.Available) { <refuse to do anything destructive> }
        $who = Get-WorktreeOccupants -Occupancy $occ -Path $candidate   # veto-worthy rows only

    ONE COPY OF THE MATCHER, ON PURPOSE. presence.ps1 (a read-only roster) and prune-merged.ps1 (which
    DELETES a worktree and its branch) must answer "is somebody in this checkout" identically. Two
    copies of a safety check drift, and the copy that drifts is the one nobody is testing -- so the
    matcher lives here, the liveness fence itself lives one level down in session-registry.ps1, and
    the path-comparison rule lives one level further down again in _common.ps1.

    AVAILABILITY IS PART OF THE ANSWER, NOT AN ABSENCE OF ONE.
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    "The fence ran and nobody is here" and "the fence could not look" produce the SAME empty row set,
    so an empty list must never be read as a green light. This returns a RECEIPT alongside the rows --
    RootsExamined / RecordsExamined / RecordsUnplaceable -- and sets Available only when there was
    something to examine: at least one config root holding a session registry, at least one readable
    record in it, AND no record that could not be PLACED. A caller about to destroy something must gate
    on Available, print the receipt, and refuse when it is false. Count what you EXAMINED, not what you
    found.

    AN UNPLACEABLE RECORD MAKES THE WHOLE FENCE UNAVAILABLE. Two shapes qualify -- a file that will not
    parse, and a record that parses but carries no cwd -- and BOTH used to be dropped on the floor by a
    silent `continue`, so they appeared in no count at all. Neither can be attributed to, or cleared
    from, any particular worktree: it could be a session sitting in the very tree the caller is about to
    delete. A file caught HALF-WRITTEN is exactly this shape, which makes it the signature of a session
    that launched seconds ago. Refusing the whole run is the only answer that cannot destroy one; the
    remedy is to look at the named file and re-run.

    RecordsExamined and RecordsUnplaceable deliberately OVERLAP: the first counts what parsed, the
    second counts what cannot be placed, and a cwd-less record is both.

    ONLY A POSITIVE ANSWER IS TRUSTWORTHY (see session-registry.ps1). There is no heartbeat, so nothing
    here can prove a session is GONE. Occupancy may therefore only ever VETO an action; a DEAD/STALE/
    absent verdict must never by itself authorise one.

    WHAT IT CANNOT SEE -- state this wherever it is consumed:
      * A session that writes into a worktree BY ABSOLUTE PATH from somewhere else. Records carry the
        cwd a session was launched in, and on the repository this tooling was developed in, measured
        over a month, 29% of the writes made by sessions sitting in the primary checkout landed in
        a sibling worktree. Those are invisible here, so a cwd-keyed fence alone is not sufficient
        protection for a destructive action. In one audit, not a single sibling worktree drew a
        veto -- including the one a session was demonstrably building in at that moment. A caller
        that destroys things needs a second, non-cwd signal; this one alone is not enough.
      * A cwd recorded as a UNC path (\\host\C$\...) or an 8.3 short path: the match is a string
        compare on the canonicalised path, and neither spelling canonicalises to the worktree's own.
      * A session that never registered at all.
    It DOES see editor-extension sessions -- <config-root>/sessions/<pid>.json is the only registry
    carrying every surface (the desktop app's own session tooling lists just what it spawned). The
    match is purely path-based, so the launching surface is irrelevant to it.

    NESTED WORKTREES. The harness (and any project configured for the nested layout) puts worktrees at
    <checkout>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>, so a worktree can live INSIDE another one. Get-WorktreeOccupancy
    attributes a session to the LONGEST matching worktree, which is right for a roster (report the
    innermost checkout) and wrong for a destructive caller: a session in the nested tree does not then
    veto its ANCESTOR, whose --force removal deletes the nested tree with it. Get-WorktreeOccupants
    -IncludeNested folds descendants in for that reason, and Get-NestedWorktrees lists them so a caller
    can refuse outright.
