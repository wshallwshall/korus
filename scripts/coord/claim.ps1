.SYNOPSIS
    Claim a piece of WORK, atomically, so two concurrent sessions cannot build the same thing twice.

.DESCRIPTION
    alloc.ps1 stops two sessions taking the same sequence NUMBER. This stops them doing the same
    WORK -- a different failure, and one that has cost real rework. On the repo this was developed
    in, three sessions independently fixed the same dependency advisory; two of the three PRs were
    closed as duplicates.

    A claim is a free-text KEY, deliberately not just a sequence number:

        claim.ps1 -Take 12                         # a numbered work item
        claim.ps1 -Take dep-advisory-path-parse    # ad-hoc work that has no number

    The number form is what the commit-msg gate enforces (see scripts/hooks/claim_check.py). The
    free-text form is what catches the case that actually bit us -- unnumbered work nobody thought
    to coordinate.

    Same test-and-set as alloc.ps1, for the same reason: it claims by EXCLUSIVELY CREATING
    <state-root>/claims/<key>.json, an atomic filesystem operation. A read-modify-write on a shared
    list is not an option (measured on the repo this was developed in, PowerShell silently lost 4 of
    8 concurrent writes to a single shared file).

    Claims are ADVISORY for free-text keys and ENFORCED for numbered ones. Neither can stop a session
    that refuses to look; what they buy is that the collision becomes visible BEFORE the work, not
    after.

    Releasing is manual and claims do NOT expire: an abandoned claim is a stale note, whereas an
    auto-expiring one silently re-opens the race it exists to prevent. -List reports each holder's
    LIVENESS -- worktree gone, or hours since its last commit -- not the claim's age. Age was the
    original signal and it was actively misleading: a 21h claim whose holder had committed two
    minutes earlier was labelled STALE and recommended for release.
