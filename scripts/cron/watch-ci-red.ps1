.SYNOPSIS
    Poll for pull requests a consuming repository has labelled red, and start one attributing seat
    per red -- without being a session itself, and without starting two seats on one failure.

.DESCRIPTION
    THE GAP THIS FILLS. When a required check fails, nothing tells any session. GitHub cannot reach
    into a session, so the only path was: a long-lived console session notices while polling, then
    spawns a seat to attribute the failure. That makes the console a single point of failure, and it
    is already the only seat the operator talks to. While it is busy, a red sits unattributed.

    THIS IS NOT A PUSH, AND MUST NOT BE DESCRIBED AS ONE. GitHub still cannot reach into a session.
    What changes is the price of asking. The consuming repository labels a pull request when a
    required check fails, so noticing costs ONE list call across every open pull request instead of
    a check-rollup fetch per pull request. That is the difference between a poll you can afford to
    run every minute and one you cannot.

    THE LABEL IS A CONTRACT, NOT A DEFINITION. The consuming repository owns the name. It is read
    from `ciRed.label` in ccx.config.json and falls back to `ci-red`. The receipt always names the
    source, so a repository that never configured one cannot be mistaken for one that did.

    FOUR PROPERTIES, EACH OF WHICH COST SOMETHING TO LEARN.

    1. THIS IS A SCRIPT, NOT A SEAT. A resident session watching for reds costs 2,108 metered tokens
    per waiting minute on a three-minute heartbeat, and 22,275 on a ten-minute sleep loop. This file
    makes zero model calls. It starts a model only when a red already exists, so a quiet repository
    costs three API round trips and nothing else.

    2. IT STARTS A FRESH SESSION; IT DOES NOT WAKE ONE. A worker that finished its turn has exited
    -- measured on the reference fleet, 740 session records against 2 live sessions -- so there is
    usually nobody to wake. The branch and the worktree survive, so a fresh session CONTINUES the
    work rather than restarting it. What does not survive is any memory of the last red, which is
    why every spawn appends to a per-pull-request journal under the state root, and why the briefing
    tells the seat to read that journal first and write to it last.

    3. IT REFUSES TO START A SEAT ON A RED SOMEBODY IS ALREADY HANDLING. Two seats attributing one
    failure is worse than none, because each assumes the other did not. The claim is taken with
    scripts/coord/claim.ps1, the repository's existing atomic claim, rather than a second registry
    invented here. Two guards are needed, because that script alone does not cover this caller:

      * ACROSS SESSIONS, claim.ps1's exclusive file create IS the mutual exclusion. A peer holding
        the key makes -Take exit non-zero, and this script skips that red.
      * ACROSS TICKS OF THIS WATCHER it is not, because re-taking a key you already hold is a
        documented SUCCESS -- a session has to be able to re-assert its own claim. Every tick runs
        from the same worktree, so every tick would re-take its own claim and exit 0. So the whole
        pass runs inside the `ci-red-watch` ccx lock, and the claim file is tested for existence
        before -Take is called.

    After -Take succeeds, this script checks that the claim file it predicted actually appeared. The
    prediction repeats a path formula that lives in claim.ps1, and a formula in two places drifts.
    If the file is not there, the run refuses to spawn and reports CLAIM-UNVERIFIABLE rather than
    spawning on a claim it cannot see -- which would spawn again on every future tick.

    A HELD CLAIM IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT ANYBODY IS STILL WORKING THE RED, and reading it as evidence
    quietly restores the failure this file exists to end. Claims never expire, nothing releases one
    on a seat's behalf, and the claim names THIS WATCHER'S checkout as the holder -- that is where
    claim.ps1 gets run from -- so every liveness probe in this repository, all of which read the
    holder's worktree, reports a live holder even when the seat died a second after it started. Every
    later tick would then print a confident ALREADY-CLAIMED, on a red nobody is looking at.

    So each spawn writes a dispatch record beside the journal: the seat's process id, the start time
    that tells that id from a reused one, and the journal's length at the moment of briefing. A later
    tick reads it and answers in three different words -- ALREADY-CLAIMED for a seat proven alive,
    SEAT-GONE for one proven not running, SEAT-UNKNOWN when it cannot tell, and it says why. The last
    two fail the run. Nothing is released or respawned on the strength of a liveness reading: a seat
    that exits without releasing may have finished, and respawning on that inference would start a
    session on every tick for as long as the label stayed on.

    4. AN EMPTY RESULT FROM AN UNPROVEN SOURCE IS UNKNOWN, NOT ZERO. Measured 2026-08-31:
    CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR pointing at a directory that does not exist makes `claude agents --json`
    return an empty list and exit 0. No error, no warning, so a mistyped root and an empty fleet are
    byte-identical. The same shape is available here three ways, and each has a control whose
    reading must come back non-empty if the check is working:

      * The repository name could be wrong. Control: the API must echo the same full name back.
      * The label may never have been created on the consumer. Control: the API must echo the same
        label name back. Without this, a contract nobody installed reads exactly like a repository
        with nothing red.
      * The list call could fail. Control: the open pull request population must be readable, and
        every pull request the label query names must also appear in it.

    A control that comes back empty makes the run CANNOT-LOOK, exit 2, and no all-clear. Every
    finding carries what was scanned beside it: the repository, the label, where each came from, and
    how many open pull requests were examined.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not decide whose failure a red is. That is the spawned seat's
    whole job, and it is why a builder-facing autofix is not a substitute: a red belongs to the pull
    request, to the trunk, to a flake, or to the merge queue, and only the first is a builder's to
    fix.

.PARAMETER Gh
    The GitHub client. Defaults to `gh` on PATH. A path to a script works too, which is how the
    tests substitute a stub with no network.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Look and report. Claim nothing, start nothing. Safe to run at any time.

.OUTPUTS
    Exit 0  Looked successfully. Reds may or may not have been found; the receipt says which.
    Exit 1  Looked successfully, and at least one red has no seat this run could show is working it
            -- a spawn that failed, a claim it cannot verify, or a claim whose seat is gone.
    Exit 2  COULD NOT LOOK. A control came back empty. This is never an all-clear.

# The claim stops a second seat starting. It does not say whether the first one is still there. Worse

# watcher runs it, so the claim records the watcher's own checkout as the holder no matter which
# session is actually attributing the red. Every liveness reading in the repository probes the
# holder's worktree, and that worktree is this one, which is always present. So the seat could have
# died a second after it started and every future tick would still read "held, by a live holder".
#
# The consequence is the exact failure the watcher exists to end, restored quietly: the claim never
# expires, nothing releases it on the seat's behalf, and every subsequent tick prints a confident
# ALREADY-CLAIMED that a reader takes for coverage. The red then waits on nobody, forever, and the
# receipt looks the same as one where somebody is mid-attribution.
#

# tells that id from a reused one, and how long the journal was at the moment the seat was briefed.

You are the attributing seat for this red. Your job is to say WHOSE failure it is, not to fix
whatever broke. A red belongs to one of four places, and only the first is a builder's to fix:

  1. The pull request. Its own change broke the check.
  2. The trunk. The check fails on the base branch too, so every pull request shows it.
  3. A flake. The same commit passes on a re-run with no change in between.
  4. The merge queue. The combination broke, not either change on its own.

Sending all four back to a builder is the failure you exist to prevent.

You start with no memory of the last red on this pull request. Read the entries above this one
before you decide anything, and append what you found below before you finish. This file is the
only thing that survives you.
