.SYNOPSIS
    Session-mail drain. Renders mail at SessionStart; consumes it only at Stop.

.DESCRIPTION
    POSTURE: FAILS OPEN, AND NEVER BLOCKS. Every path exits 0 and returns no permission decision.

    SHOW AND CONSUME ARE SPLIT ACROSS TWO EVENTS, and that split is the point. A hook that consumes
    at SessionStart loses state to a session that never really existed: one measured launch produced
    SIX SessionStart events under six different ids, and exactly one went on to submit a prompt. A
    discarded session never reaches a later event, so anything it consumed is gone with it, and
    nothing about the moment SessionStart fires can tell a real session from a phantom.

    So: render at SessionStart and leave the message in the inbox. Consume at Stop, an event a
    discarded session never reaches. Two real sessions starting before either finishes a turn will
    both display the same message. THAT IS THE ACCEPTED TRADE -- duplicate display is accepted,
    silent loss is not.

    THE MARKER IS MINTED AFTER THE EMIT, NEVER BEFORE. A first version of this design minted the
    marker before the message existed and treated any receipt as backing it. Receipts were keyed per
    message rather than per (message, session), so ONE SESSION'S RECEIPT BACKED ANOTHER SESSION'S
    MARKER and a message nobody had seen was consumed. The marker here is the proof of display: it
    is written only once the display has actually been built, and its name carries both the message
    id and the session id.

    THE CLAIM IS AN EXCLUSIVE OPEN, NOT A MOVE-AND-CATCH. Three plausible primitives fail, in
    increasing order of how convincing they look: move-and-catch reports success without moving
    under contention; checking Exists(destination) && !Exists(source) is made true for everybody by
    the winner's move; checking that your own uniquely-named destination exists returns transient
    false positives across processes. That third one passed sixteen threads in one process over
    five hundred rounds with exactly one winner each time -- and then, as sixteen SEPARATE
    PROCESSES over eight hundred rounds, more than one racer won forty-six of them. A concurrency
    result is a fact about a configuration, not about an API.

    THE BODY IS HOSTILE INPUT. It is written by anything running under this OS account, so every
    `from` field is an unverified self-assertion and the body can try to forge the frame around it.
    Every bound is enforced HERE and measured AS RENDERED -- a 34,539-byte injection once passed an
    8,000-byte cap reporting zero truncated, because the raw body was charged while the renderer
    added its own bytes per line.

    THE URGENT MID-TURN TIER IS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT. It cannot re-arm itself, re-arming belongs
    to the next hook rather than the watcher, and arming at SessionStart would spawn one watcher per
    phantom. docs/SESSION-MAIL.md also says to weigh whether the two-event drain has actually cost
    latency in practice first. Nothing has measured that here.

    WIRING IS NOT ASSERTED HERE ON PURPOSE. Whether this script is referenced by a SessionStart and
    Stop matcher is a property of a settings file, not of this script.

.PARAMETER Event
    SessionStart or Stop. Read from stdin's hook_event_name when not given.

.PARAMETER Anchor
    For a session outside a clone: names WHICH QUEUE to read. It never answers which BOX -- the box
    stays a function of this session's own cwd, or an anchored session reads the anchor's mail.
