.SYNOPSIS
    SessionStart hook. Injects this worktree's role card, or stays silent.

.DESCRIPTION
    WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR. A session is told its seat in its first message. That instruction is an
    ordinary user turn: it competes with everything else in the context and it does not survive a
    compaction. This hook binds the seat to the WORKTREE instead. Sessions come and go inside a
    worktree; the marker survives a crash, a compaction, an account switch and a respawn.

    RESOLUTION ORDER, HIGHEST FIRST.

      1. .claude/seat.local.txt in the worktree root
      2. $env:KORUS_SEAT
      3. Nothing. No card is injected and the command that sets the marker is printed.

    IT NEVER GUESSES FROM A BRANCH OR DIRECTORY NAME, and that omission is deliberate rather than
    unfinished. A worktree name is a creation-time label that nothing keeps current. This
    repository has one right now whose name describes a question its session answered in the first
    two minutes. A card is injected at the weight of the working agreement, so a WRONG card
    outranks the thing the session should have been reading. Silence costs one printed line; a
    wrong card costs a session that confidently follows another seat's rules.
    `TheHookNeverGuessesASeat` in tests/test_role_cards.py pins both the behaviour and the absence
    of any branch read in this source.

    IT NEVER FAILS A TURN. Every path exits 0, as the other hooks here do. A hook that can break a
    session is a worse fault than an undeclared seat, and this one runs in every worktree.

    WHY THE MARKER IS NAMED THAT. This repository's .gitignore states at the top of the file that
    .claude/ is DELIBERATELY NOT IGNORED, and that anything tracked under it must carry `.example.`
    in its name. Machine-local files are ignored by `*.local.*` instead. That pattern needs a
    segment AFTER `.local.`, so `.claude/seat.local` would be TRACKED and `.claude/seat.local.txt`
    is not. Measured with `git check-ignore -v`, and pinned by
    `TheMarkerCannotRideIntoACommit`.

.PARAMETER WorktreeRoot
    The worktree to resolve the seat for. Defaults to the current directory. Tests pass a
    temporary root; a real session never passes this.
