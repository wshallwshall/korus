.SYNOPSIS
    PreToolUse gate: refuse to edit a file another LIVE session is already changing.

.DESCRIPTION
    POSTURE: FAILS OPEN. Every error path exits 0 and allows the edit -- but never silently.
    (The worktree gate is the opposite posture on purpose; see docs/HOOKS.md.)

    Worktrees stop two sessions from overwriting each other's bytes. They do NOT stop two sessions
    from editing the same file in parallel and discovering it at merge -- by which point both have
    built on divergent assumptions and someone's work is thrown away. This gate turns that from a
    merge-time surprise into an edit-time refusal, which is the only point where it is still cheap.

    NOTHING TO OPT INTO. It reads git state and the session registry, both by-products of working
    normally. That is the whole design: the explicit claim tool has existed for some time and has
    been used exactly ZERO times, because a coordination step you must remember is one you will
    skip. A guard that needs cooperation to work does not work.

    ONLY LIVE SESSIONS BLOCK. A dormant worktree with changes cannot be racing you -- its owner is not
    typing -- so it is reported and allowed. Blocking on dormant worktrees would deny edits to every
    file any abandoned branch ever touched, and a gate that cries wolf gets uninstalled.

    FAILS OPEN, DELIBERATELY. Any error -- unparseable payload, no git, no registry, a broken overlap
    script -- exits 0 and allows the edit. This gate prevents rework; it must never be the reason a
    session cannot work. That is the opposite of the worktree gate's posture (which protects the
    shared tree and should fail closed), and the difference is intentional.

    FAILS OPEN, BUT NOT SILENTLY. Every one of those error paths used to `exit 0` with no output, which
    on stdout is byte-for-byte what "checked, nobody else is touching this file" looks like. So a gate
    that had checked NOTHING was indistinguishable from a gate reporting all-clear, and a session could
    read the absence of a warning as evidence -- while the guard was inert. An unresolved run now says
    so via additionalContext. It still allows: the posture is unchanged, only the silence is.

    Rate-limited per reason (`-NoticeCooldownMinutes`), because a persistently broken overlap script
    would otherwise inject a notice into EVERY Edit and Write. If the throttle state cannot be read or
    written the notice is emitted anyway -- silence is the defect being fixed, so the fallback is noise.

    Wired on Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit. The overlap map is cached, so the common case is a
    cache read, not a git walk across every worktree.

.NOTES
    VERSION-LOCKED WITH overlap.ps1. This gate reads that script's `MatchedDirty` field. Ship and
    upgrade the two together; a stale overlap.ps1 that does not emit it makes this gate degrade to
    over-blocking (see the comment at the `$editing` filter), which is the safe direction but not
    the intended one.
