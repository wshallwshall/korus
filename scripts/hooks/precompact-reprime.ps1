.SYNOPSIS
    PreCompact hook: put back the ledger facts a compaction destroys.

.DESCRIPTION
    POSTURE: FAILS OPEN, AND NEVER BLOCKS. Every path exits 0.

    WHAT A COMPACTION TAKES. A compaction summarises the conversation, and everything a session
    knows about its own held state lives in that conversation: which numbers this worktree
    allocated, which keys it claimed, and whether the branch is pushed. Afterwards the session has
    no idea it is holding an unfiled allocation, and an unfiled number BURNS if the worktree is
    removed. Allocation is a one-way door: numbers are never reclaimed.

    WHY IT READS RATHER THAN ASKS. At SessionStart the right move is to ask, because nothing is
    known yet and a machine that invents an intent writes a record that looks declared and says
    nothing. At PreCompact the record ALREADY EXISTS on disk. The compaction is about to drop it
    from context, not from the record. So this hook reads it back, which restates a stated intent
    rather than inventing one.

    IT RESTORES BOTH HALVES. The DECLARATION half reads scripts/coord/seat.ps1's episode record:
    the seat, the goal, and what the session said it would not do. The LEDGER half reads what this
    worktree holds from scripts/coord/alloc.ps1 and claim.ps1, which is the half with a PERMANENT
    cost attached -- an allocated number that is never filed BURNS.

    THE DECLARATION HALF SHIPPED SECOND, and the gap was not an oversight. Until seat.ps1 existed
    there was no declaration on disk to read, and a hook that filled the gap by inferring a goal
    would have written exactly the record this design refuses: one that looks declared and says
    nothing.

    LEGIBLE SILENCE. Holding nothing and being unable to read the ledger have opposite fixes, so
    they must not both render as blank. Each says which it is.

    IT FLAGS A RECORD THAT IS PROBABLY A PREVIOUS OCCUPANT'S. A worktree outlives the sessions in
    it. A claim whose recorded branch differs from the branch checked out now is more likely to be
    an earlier session's than this one's, and restoring it as current intent would be a
    confidently-wrong coordination fact.

    WIRING IS NOT ASSERTED HERE ON PURPOSE. Whether this script is referenced by a PreCompact
    matcher is a property of a settings file, not of this script.

    Adopted from gastown, which registers its primer at SessionStart AND PreCompact for this reason.
