"""Leak gate -- refuse to let identifying content reach a public repository.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. A repository that is going to be published carries a long tail of
strings that identify the machine, the network and the people it was written on: an absolute
home-directory path with an OS account name in it, a routable host address pasted out of a terminal,
a credential shape copied into a config example, the name of a private client or product. None of
these is a syntax error, none is a test failure, and none is a *secret* in the sense a secret
scanner means -- so nothing else in a normal toolchain looks for them. They are found by a reader,
after publication, or not at all.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a secret scanner (use one of those too -- they know key formats and
entropy far better than this does), and it is not a substitute for reading the diff. See the
"permanent blind spot" note in docs/LEAK-GATE.md before you trust it with anything.

TWO DETECTOR TIERS.

  STRUCTURAL detectors are compiled into this file and always run, because they recognise a SHAPE
  rather than a name: an absolute user-home path, a routable IPv4 address, a credential prefix.
  There is no list to keep current -- they work in a fresh fork, in CI with no secrets, in a
  contributor's clone. The home-path class is the one that actually fires in practice.

  TOKEN detectors come from a file you supply and never commit: the literal names of the private
  projects, clients, vendors, hosts or people that must not appear. Nobody can ship that list for
  you, and a public repository is the last place it could live. Sources, in precedence order:

    1. ``CCX_FORBIDDEN_TOKENS`` -- either a path to a token file OR the token content inline
       (newline-separated, same format). This is how CI supplies it, from a secret.
    2. ``scripts/security/scan-tokens.local.txt`` -- a local file next to this script, matched by
       the repository's ``*.local.*`` ignore rule so it cannot be committed by accident.

WITH NO TOKEN SOURCE THE GATE RUNS STRUCTURAL-ONLY, and says so on every run. That is a legitimate
posture -- it still catches the home-path class -- but a green result then proves much less than an
armed one, which is why the mode is printed on both the "loaded" line and the "scanned" line rather
than inferred from silence. Set ``CCX_REQUIRE_TOKENS=1`` (or pass ``--require-tokens``) to refuse
with exit 2 instead, so a misconfigured owner run cannot under-scan quietly.

PRESENCE IS NOT SUFFICIENCY. A source that loads only PART of its tokens is the dangerous case: it
satisfies "tokens present", prints no structural-only warning, and passes a gate that calls itself
fail-closed. So requiring tokens also requires every floor section to be non-empty, and
``CCX_MIN_DETECTORS=N`` (or ``--require-tokens=N``) asserts a minimum count, which is what catches
loss *within* a section. It is a floor, not an equality: adding tokens is free, losing them fails.
The expected count is supplied from OUTSIDE the token source on purpose -- a count carried inside
the file would be destroyed by the same mangling it is meant to detect.

Token-file format (sectioned; ``#`` comments and blank lines ignored):

    [names]      REGEX | REASON | CASE   -- REASON optional (default "private token"); CASE
                 optional: "i" case-insensitive (default) or "s" case-sensitive. The field
                 delimiter is a space-pipe-space (`` | ``); a regex alternation ``a|b`` is fine.
    [literals]   one substring per line, matched case-insensitively with non-letter boundaries, so
                 it fires on a token buried in an identifier (``sync_<token>_export``) which a
                 word-boundary regex cannot see -- ``_`` is a word character.

Usage:
    scan_forbidden.py [FILE ...]        # scan the named files (how a pre-commit hook invokes it)
    scan_forbidden.py --path DIR        # scan every text file under DIR (repeatable)
    scan_forbidden.py                   # scan every git-tracked file in this repository
    scan_forbidden.py --show-context    # also print the matched value and line -- LOCAL TRIAGE
                                        #   ONLY. A hit means the string is already in a file, so
                                        #   echoing it in CI copies the leak into a public log.

Exit: 0 clean, 1 forbidden content found, 2 usage error / nothing scanned / fail-closed refusal.

Stdlib only, ASCII output only, no project import: this has to run in a bare clone, in a hook with
no virtualenv, and on a runner. A gate that cannot start is a gate that is off.

# Private artifact URLs. The UUID here is not a name, it is a CAPABILITY: whoever holds the URL can
# fetch the artifact, so the string discloses the thing itself the way a token does rather than the
# way a hostname does. It arrives the way every class in this file arrives -- pasted out of a session
# into a note, a handoff, a role playbook -- and no other detector here can see it. It carries no
# home path, no host address and no credential prefix.
#
# THIS ONE IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL, WHICH IS WHY IT IS COMPILED IN. Commit a3df144 brought two of these
# into the tracked tree (roles/LANDER.md, roles/retired/PM.md) and this gate passed them both. They
# came out again in PR #48 because a person happened to read the diff -- the exact review this gate
# exists to make cheaper, doing the whole job unaided.
#
# THE UUID SHAPE IS REQUIRED ON PURPOSE, so the placeholder form the documentation has to print --
# claude.ai/code/artifact/<uuid> -- is not a hit for the detector that documents it. The alternative
# is a detector whose own manual trips it, which earns an allowlist line, and an allowlist line is a
# per-line veto over every other detector as well.
#
# A publicly shared artifact does not match either: that path segment is plural (/public/artifacts/),
# and a deliberately published URL is not a disclosure.
#
# NO BARE-UUID DETECTOR, and this is a decision rather than an oversight. A bare UUID names no host,
# no account and no project -- it is an opaque 128-bit number, and every other structural detector
# here recognises a shape that IS the disclosure. It becomes one only when something says what it
# addresses, which is precisely what the URL form supplies. Measured 2026-09-05 over the scan scope
# CI actually uses, a bare-UUID detector would have fired zero times:
#
#     find . -type f -not -path './.git/*' -print0 | xargs -0 grep -ohE '[0-9a-f]{8}(-[0-9a-f]{4}){3}-[0-9a-f]{12}' | wc -l   ->   0
#
# That zero argues against the detector rather than for it. It is a property of this tree on this
# day, not of the class: a UUID is the most common opaque identifier in software, and this project's
# own session ids are UUIDs. The first pasted session id, PowerShell New-Guid or hard-coded test GUID
# fires it, gets an allowlist line, and that line vetoes every detector on the lines it covers. A
# gate people mute is worth nothing.
# A PRIVATE ARTIFACT HAS THREE ADDRESSES, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS DETECTOR MATCHED ONE.
# Corroborated against the shipped clients rather than reasoned about, each read with a negative
# control that returned zero:
#
#     /^\/code\/(?:artifact|frame)\/(?:[A-Za-z0-9_-]<Q>-)?(<uuid>)$/
#     [`*.frame.claudeusercontent.com`, `*.frame.staging.claudeusercontent.com`]
#
# THE QUANTIFIER `<Q>` IS NOT THE SAME IN EVERY PRODUCT, and reading one binary is how this gets
# re-litigated. Measured on this machine:
#
#     CLI      claude 2.1.259        `*`   (a zero-length slug is addressable)
#     desktop  app-1.40609.1         `+`   (it is not)
#     desktop  app-1.37937.3         `+`
#
# Two sessions grepped different products, each read correctly, and each generalised to "the
# vendor". The looser grammar is the NEWER one, which is the part neither would have guessed. So
# the bound below is the UNION -- `{0,64}` addresses what either client can reach. DO NOT narrow it
# back to `{1,64}` after grepping the desktop asar alone: that reading is true and insufficient.
#
# IF YOU RE-MEASURE, PRINT THE PATTERN BESIDE THE COUNT. Three sessions counted this in one binary
# and got three answers, all correct, none comparable -- because each grepped a DIFFERENT STRING
# while calling the result global:
#
#     grep -ao 'A-Za-z0-9_-\]\*-'  | wc -l    4    the slug group's shape
#     grep -ao 'A-Za-z0-9_-\]\*'   | wc -l   23    the character class anywhere
#     within 30 bytes of `artifact`           2    the route, which is the only one that decides
#
# The same spread holds for `+`: 2, 59, and 0. There is no "global tally" that settles it; the
# number is a function of the pattern, and a count published without it cannot be reproduced or
# contradicted. This note exists because that mistake was made three times here, twice inside
# messages diagnosing it.
#
# AND THE PATTERN IS NOT THE ONLY HIDDEN INPUT. Two sessions read the same file's date, on the same
# machine, with the same command, and got 2026-08-26 and 2026-08-27. Both correct: the file landed
# at 00:07 UTC, and one reader used local time. Same artefact, same pattern, unstated timezone.
#
# So the rule is not a checklist of things to scope -- you cannot enumerate in advance the ways a
# number can be relative. It is mechanical: print what you did beside what you got.
#
# WHEN THIS WAS READ, dates in UTC because the line above is what happens otherwise. Read
# 2026-09-05, negative control 0 on each:
#
#     CLI      claude.exe 2.1.259     file dated 2026-09-05
#     desktop  app-1.40609.1          file dated 2026-09-01
#     desktop  app-1.37937.3          file dated 2026-08-27
#
# The counts, with the pattern and the window beside each:
#
#     A-Za-z0-9_-\]\*-  within 30 bytes of `artifact`     CLI 2, desktop 0
#     A-Za-z0-9_-\]+-   within 30 bytes of `artifact`     CLI 0, desktop 2
#
# WHY `{0,64}` IS WORTH BUYING WHEN ONLY ONE CLIENT RESOLVES THE FORM IT ADDS. A gate covers what a
# SHIPPED CLIENT WILL RESOLVE, not what most of them resolve. Matching a form the desktop build
# cannot address costs a false positive at worst; missing one the CLI can address costs a
# publication. The measured cost is zero in both directions -- population over the tracked tree is
# 0 lines, so nothing is newly matched and nothing newly silenced under `--show-context`.
#
# Three shapes were missed, and the middle one is the one that matters:
#
#   1. `frame` is a SIBLING PATH of `artifact`.
#   2. An optional human-readable slug may sit between the path and the UUID. THIS IS THE SHAPE THE
#      ADDRESS BAR PRODUCES, and pasting is the entire arrival path this detector exists for -- so
#      the likeliest real leak of all was the one reported clean.
#   3. The content host carries the UUID as a SUBDOMAIN, and the string `claude.ai` never appears.
#      No widening of the path arm reaches it; it needs an arm of its own.
#
# Measured over 13 forms that must fire and 9 near misses that must not: one arm failed 7, this
# fails 0. The upper bound is 64 rather than unbounded because the clients' patterns are anchored
# at both ends and this one is not. The lower bound is 0 because the CLI's `*` admits a zero-length
# slug, which leaves a bare hyphen and still addresses the artifact -- `{1,64}` reported
# `artifact/-<uuid>` clean.
#
# WIDENING THIS PATTERN IS NOT A ONE-SIDED RISK ONCE `_VALUE_IS_THE_DISCLOSURE` EXISTS, which it
# does NOT in this file -- it arrives with the branch that stacks above this one, and this pattern
# joins it there. Stated in the future tense on purpose: the two paragraphs below were first
# written in the present, describing a tuple and a control neither of which is in the file the
# comment sits in. True of the branch above, read as true of this one, which is the same mistake
# this whole comment block is about.
#
# There, over-reach is LOUD in detection -- a false positive fails a run -- and SILENT in
# suppression: a too-greedy pattern would quietly stop `--show-context` printing context across the
# whole corpus, and every control asserting a value is ABSENT would stay green while it happened.
#
# `ContextSurvivesOnALineThatDisclosesNothing`, also on that branch, is the corpus for the case, and
# this comment first said it CATCHES it, which claimed more than it delivers. It plants ONE line --
# `the host is <an address>` -- so only an over-reach broad enough to match prose reddens. Measured:
# a pattern widened to any claude.ai URL, to any run of hex and hyphens, or to any http URL leaves
# it GREEN. Only `.` reddens it. A corpus of one chosen line, asserted as a general property.
#
# So what evidences that this widening silenced nothing is a POPULATION reading rather than that
# control: zero lines in the tracked tree match the widened pattern. Weaker in a specific way worth
# naming -- it says nothing about lines that do not exist yet.
#: The UUID itself, shared by both arms so they cannot drift apart.
