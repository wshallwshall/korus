"""Every structural detector in the leak gate, proved against a line it MUST flag and one it must not.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, and it is a measured one rather than a worry. Commit `a3df144` brought
two private artifact URLs into the tracked tree, at `roles/LANDER.md:4027` and
`roles/retired/PM.md:200`. The gate ran over both and exited `0`. They came out again in PR #48
because a person read the diff -- the same review the gate exists to make cheaper, doing the entire
job unaided. Nothing about that run looked wrong: the receipt said `structural=8`, the scan counted
every file, and the exit code was the one a clean tree produces.

That is the failure this directory is about, in the one script whose only job is to prevent it.
`docs/LEAK-GATE.md` states the rule the gate could not keep for itself:

    A green gate is evidence only if you have proved it can SEE that class.

Until this file existed, `scripts/security/scan_forbidden.py` had no test of any kind. Every green
run it had ever produced was unfalsifiable -- a detector that never compiled, a regex quietly
narrowed, a whole branch deleted: all three exit `0` and print a healthy receipt.

TWO CORPORA PER DETECTOR, BECAUSE ONE PROVES HALF. A detector hard-wired to fire passes the planted
case perfectly. A detector hard-wired to stay silent -- or one whose reader found no files -- passes
the clean case perfectly. Only running both rules out both, which is the rule
`test_every_validation_check_is_proven_by_a_control.py` already imposes on `scripts/validation/`.
This file brings `scripts/security/` under the same one.

THE TABLE IS DRIVEN OFF THE DETECTOR COUNT, so tomorrow's detector is covered the day it is added.
`_STRUCTURAL_COUNT` is the number the gate prints on its own receipt; a detector added without a
planted line makes `TheTableCoversEveryDetectorTheGateClaims` fail, rather than quietly shipping a
column nobody proved. A control pinned to one detector is a control the next detector is written
without.

EVERY FIXTURE IS ASSEMBLED FROM FRAGMENTS, and that is load-bearing rather than a matter of taste.
The gate scans this repository, `tests/` included. A planted home path or artifact URL written as
one literal would make this file a hit -- the control would break the gate it exists to prove, and
the obvious repair is an allowlist line, which is a per-line veto over every other detector on that
line. So no single source line here is a violation; only the joined value is.
`ThePlantedFixturesNeverBecomeALeakThemselves` keeps that true under editing, instead of trusting
that whoever adds the next fixture notices.

#: the narrowed gate catches the old fixture and MISSES a real-shaped id.

#: Both URLs PR #48 removed contain hex letters, and an all-digit v4 UUID has a probability of
#: roughly 1 in 2.7 million -- so the single input the control proved was the one input that never
#: arrives. That is this file's own stated failure, committed inside the file that exists to
#: prevent it: a green run that proves nothing about the class it names.
#:
#: `.upper()` must also CHANGE it, or the uppercase row is a duplicate of the row above it and

    WHY IT EXISTS. Every other control here asserts a value is ABSENT from the output. All of them
    pass against a gate that suppresses context unconditionally -- `ctx = ""` with the branch
    deleted reddens nothing. So this pins the COST of `_VALUE_IS_THE_DISCLOSURE` rather than its
    benefit: a line carrying none of those classes keeps the context a person asked for.

    WHY IT IS A TABLE, and this is the measured part. The first version planted one line, `the host
    is <address>`, and its docstring claimed "widen a pattern in that tuple until it matches
    ordinary text and this is what reddens". That was false. Measured 2026-09-05: `re.IGNORECASE`
    over the whole `_HOME_PATH` -- which newly matches `GET /users/me` and every other `/users/`
    route -- reddened NOTHING in this file. The fixture carried no `/users/`, no drive letter and
    nothing home-path shaped, so no widening of that pattern could reach it however far it went.

    A pattern in the tuple has TWO jobs, detection and suppression. Over-reach is loud in the first
    and SILENT in the second, so the bait has to be chosen per class: ordinary text that the
    plausible widening of THAT pattern would newly match. One line cannot bait three classes.

    Each row carries a co-occurring routable address, which is what produces a hit to inspect. The
    address is that detector's own finding rather than a capability, so its line is not withheld.
