"""The prose checker. Hard-fail where a violation is unambiguous, baselined ratchet everywhere else.

WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR. `docs/HOUSE-STYLE.md` states the writing rules and nothing enforced any of
them, so the only thing standing between the corpus and a slow drift back was whether a reviewer
happened to remember a rule identifier. This file enforces the subset that CAN be enforced and says
plainly which subset that is.

THE DESIGN RULE, taken from the writing plan and not negotiable here: hard-fail ONLY where a
violation is unambiguous and the current corpus is clean. A gate that reddens a legitimate editorial
choice is one people delete, and the repository already recorded that judgment once in
`test_docs_do_not_drift.TheBlufConventionHasOneSpelling`.

WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE CHOOSING, because the choice is the whole design. Every candidate pattern
was run over the corpus on 2026-08-08 and every hit was read:

  B-7  "cleanly", "elegantly", "robustly"      16 hits, ~0 genuine  -> NOT ENFORCED
  B-5  "in order to", "utilize", "leverage"    10 hits,  1 genuine  -> ENFORCED, narrowed
  B-3  "Importantly", "It is worth noting"      5 hits,  0 genuine  -> ENFORCED, narrowed
  B-10 a heading that is a question             1 hit,   0 genuine  -> NOT ENFORCED

B-7 IS THE INSTRUCTIVE ONE AND IT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. The rule bans those adverbs "describing
this project's own work". Measured, every single hit was standard technical vocabulary instead:
`git merges both cleanly`, `a session that exits cleanly`, `an execution-alias stub that resolves
cleanly`, `a transform producing valid-but-wrong output passes cleanly`. The distinction the rule
draws is about WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED, and no pattern over the text can see that. Enforcing it would
redden sixteen correct sentences to catch nothing, so it stays a review item. The same reasoning
retires B-10: its one hit, `## The one question: does failing it stop the change?`, is a question the
section immediately answers, which is not the rhetorical opener the rule is about.

B-5 IS NARROWED TO THE UNAMBIGUOUS FORMS. Bare "leverage" is a noun as often as a verb here --
`ordered by its own leverage`, `the highest-leverage gate` -- so only the participles and the
unmistakable phrases are enforced. The one genuine violation the scan found, a cloud program that had
`begun leveraging an external framework`, was fixed in the same commit that added this file, because
a hard-fail rule whose corpus is already red is a rule that ships disabled.

THE RULE SHEET MUST BE ABLE TO QUOTE WHAT IT BANS. `docs/HOUSE-STYLE.md` lists every banned
construction verbatim in its own tables, so a naive scan reddens the one file that defines the rules.
The exemption is deliberately NARROW: a table row whose first cell is a rule identifier, and nothing
else. Exempting the whole file would leave the rule sheet the only unchecked prose in the repository.

WHAT IS REPORTED RATHER THAN FAILED, and why each is not a hard fail:

  cross-file duplication   HS-3, but which of two copies should go is an editorial call
  table cell word counts   fourteen files exceed 40 words per cell, SECURE-DEVELOPMENT among them
  long sentences           a cap at 30 fires on 1,397 of 6,579; the long tail carries the warnings

Each is a RATCHET against a baseline measured from the corpus. It may not get worse. If it gets
better the test says so and asks for the baseline to be lowered, because a ratchet nobody tightens is
a number that stops meaning anything.

`roles/` WAS THE CORPUS NOTHING READ, AND IT IS THE LARGER HALF. Until 2026-09-04 this checker read
`docs/`, `README` and `INSTALL` and stopped there. Measured at `1b6b7fc` over the paths
`git ls-files` returns: `docs/` with the two root pages is 36 files and 115,357 words of markdown;
`roles/` is 15 files and 180,043. So the unread half was 61% of the corpus, and it is the half every
epistemic mechanism here is actually written in. Those are WHOLE-FILE word counts, the quantity the
empty-corpus guard below reads; the ratchets read a smaller one, prose after tables, headings and
fenced blocks come out.

WHAT WIDENING COST, and it is the reason to do it now rather than later. The three hard-fail patterns
fire ZERO times across `roles/`, so B-3, B-5 and B-6 extended to it with no page edited and no
exemption added. The three ratchets did not: `roles/` measures 708 long sentences, 138 fat table
cells and 986 fat paragraphs against `docs/` figures of 49, 10 and 0.

THE RATCHETS ARE PER-CORPUS, NOT SHARED, and that is the whole of the design. See
`ROLES_BASELINE_FAT_PARAGRAPHS` for the argument; the short form is that one shared number would
hand `docs/` 986 paragraphs of headroom against a cap `docs/` has already reached.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reported, and ratcheted. These may not get worse.

# Measured on 2026-08-08, AFTER the standards left for their own repository. The figures roughly
# halved with them, which is the whole point of a ratchet being re-derived rather than carried:
# keeping the old numbers would have left a gate that could never fail.
#
# MEASURE WITH THE FILES STAGED. `prose_files()` reads `git ls-files`, so a baseline taken before a
# deletion is staged still counts the deleted pages.
# To change one, run the test: it names the current figure and which direction it moved.
#
# These are lower than the figures in the writing plan (which counted 1,397 long sentences) because
# that count included headings, table rows and block quotes. This one is prose only, for the same
# reason PD-4 exists: a table row is not a sentence and shortening it is not an improvement.
# 470 -> 390 ON 2026-08-10 WITH NO SENTENCE EDITED. Both drops were measurement errors in this
# file, found by the sibling standards repository in its own copy of this checker and reproduced
# here: 17 for a bullet list rejoined into one blob, 67 for a stop inside `**` not counting as a
# stop. 80 of the old 470, or 17%, was the instrument rather than the prose. Any figure quoted from
# a scan before this date should be re-derived. Both are pinned by planted cases above, because a
# corpus check cannot find them -- the corpus is where the wrong number came from.
#
# 390 -> 294 ON 2026-08-10 BY EDITING PROSE, in a sweep over the 18 pages the site RENDERS. Every
# edit split a sentence carrying two independent claims joined by a dash or a semicolon, where
# splitting cost no fact; five enumerations became lists. Nothing was cut: the checklist that
# prompted the sweep was measured against this corpus first and found nothing to purge, with B-5,
# B-11, B-12, B-13 and B-14 all firing zero times and every `very`/`really` hit load-bearing.
#
# 294 -> 290 ON 2026-08-10 by the OPEN-7 pass, which gave all 18 rendered pages a three-answer
# opening. That pass ADDED prose and still came out ahead, because this ratchet caught its own new
# sentences: eight of the openings were written over 30 words, and the failure named them before the
# work landed rather than after.
#
# 68 OF THE REMAINING 290 WERE IN README.md AND INSTALL.md, which neither sweep touched. They are in
# this corpus but are not site pages: they live at the repository root, outside the Jekyll source, so
# the site links them as raw `.md` rather than serving them. They were named here as the obvious next
# chunk, and 68 as the figure to beat. That chunk was taken on 2026-08-16, below.
#
# 181 -> 59 AND 19 -> 11 ON 2026-08-16, in the pass that rebuilt the site as a KORUS how-to guide.
# Every page under docs/ was rewritten for a reader rather than for completeness, and README.md and
# INSTALL.md were swept for the first time. The two figures moved for the same reason and by the same
# means: a sentence carrying two independent claims became two sentences, and a paragraph that
# narrated its own reasoning before reaching the fact lost the narration.
#
# NOTHING WAS REACHED BY DELETION, and that was checked rather than asserted. Every numeric token and
# every link target in the pre-pass revision was diffed against the post-pass one. Three pages came
# back with a token missing; two were deliberate (a range rewritten as `HS-20 to HS-23`, a date
# restated twice and now stated once) and the third was a real loss -- the ASVS large-assessment link
# dropped when the landing page was split -- which was restored to the page that now owns that case.
BASELINE_LONG_SENTENCES = 58        # sentences over 30 words
BASELINE_FAT_TABLE_CELLS = 11       # table cells over 40 words

# HS-20: a paragraph over 300 characters. THE BASELINE IS NOW ZERO, SO THIS IS A CAP RATHER THAN A
# RATCHET, and the next paragraph written over the limit fails the run rather than being absorbed.
#
# It did not start that way, and the history is the argument for the mechanism. The rule was written
# on 2026-08-10 against a measured corpus: 391 of 1,387 rendered-site paragraphs were over the limit,
# a shade under a third, so a hard fail would have shipped disabled on day one for the reason this
# file's header states. It shipped as a ratchet at 88 instead, and the debt was paid down to nothing
# on 2026-08-16.
#
# TREAT A FAILURE HERE AS A CAP BEING HIT, NOT AS A NUMBER TO RAISE. Raising it re-opens the debt
# this took two sweeps to clear, and the corpus can no longer absorb a paragraph silently.
#
# THE FIX IS A REWRITE, NOT A SPLIT. Chopping a long paragraph in half satisfies the number and
# changes nothing a reader experiences: the same prose arrives in two pieces. An over-long paragraph
# here is treated as a signal that the writing wound up, restated itself, or narrated its own
# reasoning before getting to the fact. What comes out is shorter because it says the same things in
# fewer words -- never because a measurement, a date, a limit or a mechanism sentence was dropped.
# PD-1 through PD-7 outrank this rule, and an editor who satisfies it by deleting a number has
# broken the sheet rather than served it.
#
# 88 -> 15 ON 2026-08-16, and the corpus is no longer meaningfully red behind this rule. Every page
# under docs/ now carries ZERO paragraphs over the limit; all 15 that remain are in README.md and
# INSTALL.md, the two files that live at the repository root and had never been swept.
#
# THE RULE WENT UP BEFORE IT CAME DOWN, which is the part worth keeping. The same pass that fixed the
# corpus first made it worse -- 88 to 110 -- because four new pages and a batch of rewrites each added
# a paragraph or two over the limit, and every one of them read fine in isolation. The ratchet named
# all 22 with their line numbers before the work landed. Nothing else would have: this defect is
# invisible to review, because the offending paragraph is never the one you are looking at.
#
# 15 -> 0 the same day, once the last two files were swept. Every page in the corpus is now under
# the limit, including README.md and INSTALL.md.

# HOW THEY WERE MEASURED, because a number without its instrument is not a measurement.
#
#   python -m pytest tests/test_prose_rules_hold.py -q
#
# On a clean tree that is the whole instrument: set a ROLES_ baseline to 0 and the run names the
# true figure in its own failure text. THE TREE WAS NOT CLEAN when these were taken. `git status`
# reported uncommitted edits to four files under `docs/` and three under `roles/`, none of them
# this one, so the working tree was a moving subject and a figure read off it could not be
# re-derived from any ref. How many sessions held those edits was not measured and is not claimed.
#
# SO THE BASELINES ARE MEASURED AT `HEAD`, through this file's own `paragraphs()` and
# `scannable_lines()` over `git show HEAD:<path>` for every path `role_prose_files()` returns.
# Same code, stable subject. Anyone can reproduce them by running the command above on a clean
# checkout of that commit.
#
# WHAT THE TWO SUBJECTS RETURNED, docs alongside roles for comparison:
#
#                                    HEAD              working tree
#   long sentences over 30 words     docs 49  roles 708    docs 49  roles 708
#   table cells over 40 words        docs 10  roles 138    docs 12  roles 140
#   paragraphs over 300 characters   docs  0  roles 986    docs  3  roles 987
#
# THE WORKING-TREE COLUMN IS THE RATCHET DOING ITS JOB, not noise to baseline away. Eight
# regressions across four corpus-and-metric pairs, none of them in this file's diff, every one named
# before the edits carrying them were even committed. Baselining to that column would have gone
# green and bought somebody else's regressions with this file's signature on the purchase.
#
# THEY WERE ALSO TRANSIENT, which is the second half of the argument for `HEAD`. Between the first
# reading and the last the docs figures moved 10 -> 12 -> 10 and 0 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0 as the other
# edits were revised. Every one of those was a real reading, and any of them baselined would have
# been wrong within the hour.
#
# THE THREE HARD-FAIL PATTERNS RETURNED ZERO on `roles/`, which is why B-3, B-5 and B-6 widened to
# the union corpus with no page edited. The ratchets could not follow, and that asymmetry is the
# honest result rather than an obstacle: a rule the corpus already satisfies costs nothing to
# enforce, and a rule it does not is debt that has to be named before it can be paid.
#
# WHAT WAS NOT VARIED, and it bounds every figure above. All six numbers come from ONE revision of
# ONE repository on ONE day. They say nothing about whether `roles/` is worse prose than `docs/`:
# `roles/` was never swept, and `docs/` was swept twice (2026-08-10 and 2026-08-16, both recorded
# above). The comparison measures sweeps, not authors.

# `_markdown_under`'s docstring refuses at a scale of six. `docs/` reached zero over two sweeps;
# folding `roles/` in would hand every page under `docs/` 986 paragraphs of silent headroom against
# a cap it has already met. The cap would survive as a constant and stop being reachable.
#
# REJECTED: excluding `roles/` from HS-20 the way OPEN-8 pages are excluded. The OPEN-8 reason does
# not transfer. Those pages are exempt because no edit is AVAILABLE -- they are published in their
# author's words. A role playbook is edited here every week, so the debt is payable, and an
# exclusion would record none of the paying.
#
# CHOSEN: a second ratchet, measured, sitting beside the cap rather than inside it. It cannot go up,
# it names the new figure whenever a sweep brings it down, and `docs/` keeps its zero.
#
