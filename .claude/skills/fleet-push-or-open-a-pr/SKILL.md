### The PR route: every seat pushes its own, and the Lander merges

**Owner-set 2026-08-29, three steps.** Create the pull request and notify the Reviewer. The Reviewer
posts any findings on the pull request. On approval the Reviewer passes it to the Lander, which
merges. Creating the pull request means pushing your own branch, and that needs no approval.

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Notification is a courtesy, not the trigger | The Reviewer finds waiting pull requests itself. Nothing pushes a notice to it. |
| Findings go on the pull request | Never back to an author, which has usually exited. *Your pull request has to survive your own exit* covers what it must carry. |
| RETIRED 2026-09-04, the label | No label blocks a merge. The owner removed the review gate. The required checks on `main` are `gates (ubuntu-latest)` and `gates (windows-latest)`. |
| Do not spend a turn on it | `reviewed` now carries no machine meaning. Do not apply it, wait on it, or read a pull request as blocked for want of it. |
| What that label proved, kept | That a step happened, not that a party looked. A seat could label a pull request it wrote itself and satisfy the machine. Any gate keyed on a self-appliable mark has this shape. |
| Direct pushes to `main` | Still blocked by the harness. Branch and pull request is the path. |
| RETIRED 2026-08-31, the fallback | The old route around an absent Reviewer. See [REVIEWER.md](../../../roles/REVIEWER.md), *You sit in the pull request path*. |

**What the retired rows used to say**, kept because seats still quote them.

The 2026-08-29 fallback, retired on 2026-08-31:

*"If no Reviewer is running, hand the PR to the Lander as before -- a route through an absent seat
is a stall."*

The sentence that retired it, whose gate is now gone:

*"Since the review gate was armed the Lander cannot merge an unlabelled pull request either. Start a
Reviewer, have any other running seat read the diff and label it."*

**Do not read that as the fallback returning.** Whether the Reviewer stays in the pull request path
is the owner's call. Nothing here answers it, and no seat should act as though it has.

## A new test file is unlandable until the manifest classifies it

Source of record: `tests/tooling_manifest.txt` and its guard
`tests/test_tooling_partition.py::test_every_non_engine_test_is_classified`.

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| When it applies | You added a file under `tests/`. Ask before you commit, not after CI answers for you. |
| The question | Does it import `messagefoundry`, `messagefoundry_webconsole`, `harness` or `tee`? If yes, it is exempt. |
| The rule | If it imports none of them, add its path to `tests/tooling_manifest.txt` in the same commit. |
| The path form | Write the path exactly as `git diff --name-only` reports it. `ci.yml` matches with `grep -qxFf`, so a bare basename matches nothing. |
| Do not sort | The manifest is read as a `set()` and is already unsorted on `main`. Sorting it rewrites unrelated lines into your diff. |
| Insert, do not move | Put the one new line at its alphabetical slot and leave every other line untouched. |
| The check | Run `pytest tests/test_tooling_partition.py` before you commit. It takes under a second. |
| Why it is not optional | The guard reds all three required test legs, and it is not marked `tooling`, so `-m 'not tooling'` does not deselect it. |
| Why you will not see it | It fails only in CI, after your process has exited. The pull request looks fine when you open it and can never go green. |
| The cost, measured | 2026-09-04: eight open pull requests were unlandable for this one missing line each. None of them could ever have merged. |

## Your pull request has to survive your own exit

Your process ends when the pull request opens. Nothing you author is watched by you afterwards, so
anything left half-done stays half-done until a different session notices. Leave it self-sufficient.

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| The invalidation race | RETIRED SUBJECT, LIVE LESSON. Where a check invalidates on an event, the event is the gate's own RUN, not your command returning. Acting straight after a push loses. |
| The order | Push. Wait for that branch's run to reach `completed`. Then act. Then read the state back. |
| The cost, measured | 2026-09-04: 15 of 16 pull requests had NO `reviewed` label, though the labelling command reported success on every one. The review gate's `synchronize` run stripped it after each push returned. |
| The gate that taught it is gone | The owner removed the review gate on 2026-09-04, so `reviewed` no longer gates anything. The race above is a property of gates, not of that one, so it recurs. |
| Read the newest run | A label cycle fired both an `unlabeled` run that failed and a `labeled` run that succeeded. The rollup shows the stale red; the newest run per name is the truth. |
| Do not trust exit 0 | `gh pr edit`, `gh run cancel` and `gh pr merge --disable-auto` can each report success and change nothing. Read the state back. |
| Re-derive, never reuse | Run ids and check ids go stale the moment a head moves. Re-derive with `gh run list -c "$sha"` at the current head. |
| Leave the question on it | If your brief left something open, write it in the pull request body. There is no session to ask later, and a comment is the only channel that outlives you. |

## The merge queue belongs to one seat, and BEHIND is not your problem

Source of record: `roles/LANDER.md`. This section is what every other session needs so it does not
fight the queue by accident. The rules that catch these errors live in *Measure it before you
conclude* and *A green light proves only what the gate asserts*. These are the instruments they
apply to.

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| A queue IS enabled | Branch protection does not expose merge-queue config, so a missing `merge_queue` key there proves nothing. Read it with the GraphQL `mergeQueue(branch:"main")` field before proposing to enable one. |
| Do not enqueue or dequeue | The queue is the Lander's, and it is one seat's job precisely so these races stop. Dequeuing also deletes the entry's `gh-readonly-queue` branch and orphans every run already queued against it. |
| Never `gh pr update-branch` -- **WHERE A QUEUE EXISTS** | The queue rebases each entry against the `main` it will actually land on, so BEHIND is not a merge blocker. Measured 2026-09-03: a pull request read BEHIND, the label was added with no push, and it went CLEAN. |
| **THAT CONDITION WAS MISSING UNTIL 2026-09-06, and this repository is where it bites** | The row above read as an absolute. It is right on the engine and wrong here. |
| The reading, with the control that arms it | `mergeQueue(branch:"main")` returns `null` on `wshallwshall/korus` and `MQ_kwDOS5JJRs4AA9_8` on `MEFORORG/MessageFoundry`, both read 2026-09-06. Both repository nodes returned an `id`, so the null is an absence, not a lookup failure. |
| What follows in a repository with no queue | Nothing rebases an entry. Under `strict=true`, BEHIND blocks until somebody runs `update-branch`, and it is the only thing that clears it. |
| The worked instance | korus PRs 57 and 58 each needed it to land on 2026-09-06. 58's head moved `a8d4e802` to `a7ee3c00`, a merge commit whose second parent `53ac1bde` was the `main` tip at that moment. |
| So run *A queue IS enabled* FIRST | That row already tells you to read `mergeQueue` rather than infer it from branch protection. This prohibition depends on its answer. |
| What a rebase costs | Every `update-branch` fires a `synchronize`, which restarts every required context. It buys nothing here. It also stripped `reviewed`, until that gate went on 2026-09-04. |
| Never arm auto-merge | Enqueuing is the Lander's call. Auto-merge fires on the head it SAW, so a later push is dropped: the pull request reads MERGED, the branch stays alive, and nothing reports a problem. |
| Read the log, then rerun | Name the failing test and its mechanism before rerunning. One rerun. A second red on the same leg is a finding, not a flake. Record which leg and which head SHA on the pull request. |
| `completed` is not `succeeded` | `status == completed` includes `skipped` and `cancelled`. Count `conclusion`. Measured: 79 of 100 runs were skipped. |
| Run status is not job status | A run reports `queued` while its jobs are completing. When the question is "is work happening", read `actions/runs/<id>/jobs`. |
| What to send the Lander | A pull request that is genuinely ready, with any defect you know of named; a red you have diagnosed, with the mechanism; a correction with the command you ran. |
| What not to send | A recommendation to enqueue, dequeue, rebase or rerun. |
