### Before you allocate, grep the ALLOC TITLES for your subject, not the ledger

`alloc.ps1` prevents two sessions taking the same number for different subjects. That is its one job
and it does it. **It cannot know that two titles describe one defect.**

The ledger gate, the claim gate and the pre-commit hook are all keyed on numbers, so a subject
duplicate passes every one and merges clean. Measured 2026-08-29: `#1303` and `#1360` carried
character-identical titles, five days and two worktrees apart.

`#1303` never filed a row, so it is invisible to any search of `docs/BACKLOG.md`. An unfiled
allocation exists only in the alloc records, which is why those are the thing to search.

### A filed row does not learn

A backlog row is a snapshot of what was true when it was written, and every screen reads it as
current. A ruling made after a row is filed never touches the row.

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| What to check | Before you act on filed work, ask whether a later ruling touches its subject. Start from the row's own filed date and match by subject, because no ruling cites a backlog number. |
| The ruling may live in another repository | For publishing or moving material, the decision lives where the material lives. Grep the vault's `docs/security/` for a decision naming the row's subject. |
| The dangerous direction | A row filed before a ruling cannot have known about it. A row filed after probably did. So the gap to check runs backwards from the row, not forwards. |
| Do not over-trigger | Default to NOT BLOCKED when unsure. Check whether the ruling was scoped to a pass or a batch that has since concluded. |

**Why the engine repo can look clean and still be wrong.** Nothing there need record that a vault
ruling exists.

**Why over-triggering is the expensive error.** A false collision takes a real row away from a
builder, and supply is this fleet's binding constraint.

## A row needs a diff. Otherwise write a rule

**A backlog row implies a change to the repository. If nothing in the repository is wrong, there is
nothing to close, and the row sits open forever.**

The worked case: a CLI returned a correct arity error for a malformed command typed at a terminal. The
CLI is right, the error is right, and the fault is in what a human typed. There is no diff. A rule
prevents the next one; a row would never close.

| Ask | Then |
| --- | --- |
| Is there a file whose contents are wrong? | File a row. |
| Is the code correct and the READING of it wrong? | Write a rule. |

## The backlog banner alphabet is the one holdout

Source of record: `docs/LEDGER-GATE.md`, the open-count control section.

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Where it lives | Put a banner character only in `docs/BACKLOG.md` and `docs/archive/backlog/BACKLOG-CLOSED.md`. |
| Item bodies | Never put a banner character in an item body, in emphasis or in a nested blockquote. |
| Why it bites | A stray banner character reads as a status, and a false CLOSED hides a live item. |
| How to read it | Import `parse_items` from `scripts/docs/backlog_status_check.py`. Never write your own scan. |
| The control | Run the `parse_items` counts before and after every `docs/BACKLOG.md` edit, and diff them. |
| Expected deltas | Read the expected deltas from the open-count control section of `docs/LEDGER-GATE.md`. |
