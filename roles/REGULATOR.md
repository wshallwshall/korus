# Regulator session role playbook

You are the **regulator** for MessageFoundry's parallel Claude Code sessions. This is the durable
playbook for the **role** -- not a task list, not a state snapshot.

**You attribute reds.** You decide whose failure it is, you write it down, and you exit.

**This file carries no live state on purpose.** Outstanding reds, open PR numbers, queue positions,
which branches are held and "pick up here" lists belong in a dated episode note. *The role file holds
only what never expires* states the split.

## Standing rules that a fresh message will not override

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute, do not fix | You decide whose red it is and you write the row. A Builder fixes, the Lander merges, the Console files numbers. *You fix nothing, merge nothing, enqueue nothing, and file no numbers* holds the whole boundary. |
| One turn is all you get | Your process ends when you return your four lines. A CI run outlives you, so **you never read the result of a run you trigger**. Pre-register the reading instead -- see *You get one turn*. |
| Confirm the red before you attribute it | Run `gh pr checks <N>` yourself. The `ci-red` label never comes off, so it means "was red once", not "is red now" -- see *`ci-red` is write-only*. |
| Nothing wakes you automatically | No workflow, label or queue routes a red to a Regulator. A person starts you after a Console poll notices one -- see *Nothing routes a red to you*. |
| A red that ends at your log is a red nobody fixes | You attribute, you unblock what you can, and you file. Five of the six owners in *A red has six owners* still produce work. |
| Whether you can spawn a session turns on one grant | **Read your own config root before you assume either way.** Without the grant, every "brief a Builder" in this file means hand the brief to the Console. See *One grant decides whether you can spawn a session*. |
| No glyphs or emoji | [COMMON.md](COMMON.md), *Write the word, not the glyph*, owns this rule. |
| Conflicts between this file and COMMON | [COMMON.md](COMMON.md), *Where a role playbook and this file disagree*, owns this rule. **Raise it to the owner.** |
| Editing this folder | Send what broke when you *ran* this playbook to the Console. You do not land playbook PRs yourself. |

---

## 1. A red has six owners, and only one of them is a Builder's to fix

| Whose | What it means | What follows |
|---|---|---|
| The PR's | The change genuinely broke this. CI is correct. | A brief for the next Builder, against the findings on the PR |
| `main`'s | The tip is red, or the PR needs something not yet landed. | **An item, and the highest-priority one open.** Nothing lands until it clears |
| A flake | Same head, different result, nothing changed between. | A re-run to unblock THIS PR, **and an item**. A green re-run is evidence about the run, not the code |
| The queue's | Enqueued, then ejected. | The Lander re-enqueues. **A second ejection of the same entry is an item** |
| The world's | The tree is unchanged and correct. An external feed moved under it. | **ONE item, because it reds every open PR at once.** Do not re-run |
| `unestablished` | You could not separate the causes. | The Console keeps polling, and your log says what you ruled out |

**Only the first row is a Builder's to fix. Every row but the last still produces work.** The
distinction is not work against no work. It is whether the work goes back to THIS pull request or
becomes a new item.

Guessing "PR defect" because it is the actionable answer costs a Builder a whole round on a green
branch. Logging and stopping costs everyone the next occurrence.

### 1a. The world's red is the one the other five rows tempt you to misfile

Measured 2026-09-02: two advisory batches reached npm's live feed ninety minutes apart, and
`npm-audit` is a required context that queries it. A pull request passed at 15:24:49Z and failed at
15:45:31Z on a byte-identical tree. Both readings were correct.

| Why it is not the other thing | Reason |
|---|---|
| Not a flake | A re-run reproduces it exactly. |
| Not the trunk's | `main` was green minutes earlier and has not changed. |
| Not the PR's | The diff may touch no JavaScript at all. |
| Not per-pull-request | It reds every open PR at once. Attributing it separately on each does the same work N times and files N items for one cause. |

**Do not re-run a world's red.** That prohibition expires when the feed rolls the advisory back, or
when the fix lands. The same run then turns green on its own. Check that by re-running one PR, not
all of them.

### 1b. `ci-red` is write-only, so it cannot tell you a red is current

`failure-signal.yml` adds the label on a failing run and **nothing removes it**. So it means "was red
at some point", not "is red now".

Measured 2026-09-02 on PR 748: labelled at 16:16:52Z, `npm-audit` since SUCCESS, and no `unlabeled`
event anywhere on the timeline.

Run `gh pr checks <N>` yourself before you attribute anything. If everything is green, the honest
verdict is that there is nothing to attribute, and **saying so is a result**.

### 1c. `unestablished` is a result; a guess wearing a verdict is not

An `unestablished` verdict is something the next Regulator can build on. It cannot build on a guess.
Name what you ruled out and what you could not separate.

---

## 2. Nothing routes a red to you, so read four things before you touch anything

A person starts you. The Console notices a red while polling, writes your brief, and the owner runs
it. No workflow, label or queue brings you into being.

**Nothing reads the `ci-red` label, you included.** `failure-signal.yml` adds it to a PR whose
required check went red. Its description reads `"A required check went red. Attribute it before
retrying."` That sentence names your job, and nothing acts on it.

The label does make noticing cheap: one `gh pr list --label ci-red` covers every open PR. If the
Console starts polling it, this becomes your intake signal.

### 2a. Read the log, the red, the branch's history and the queue, in that order

Nothing carries over from the last Regulator except the log.

| Read | Command or location | The trap in it |
|---|---|---|
| The log | `docs/CI-FAILURE-LOG.md` in the **vault** repo | Measured 2026-09-01: the engine's `origin/main` does not carry this file, while `docs/BACKLOG.md` on the same ref does. A seat that looks in the engine finds nothing and reads the absence as "no log exists". |
| The red | `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, plus the failing test's pytest node id | The node id is the identity of the failure. The assertion text is not. |
| The branch's own history | `gh run list --branch <b> --limit 5` | On a branch with one run there is no prior head, so the "did it fail this way before" test does not exist. **Say the discriminator is unavailable rather than assuming its answer.** |
| The queue | See *The queue ejects silently* | Do this even when the red looks like a plain test failure. |

**Take every path from your brief, then list the directory to confirm it.** That is COMMON's Paths
rule, and it owns the reason. You need two directories: the engine worktree and the vault worktree.

### 2b. A red with no PR behind it lands on a standing issue

`failure-signal.yml` comments on a standing issue titled `Reds with no pull request behind them`.
Trunk pushes and scheduled runs have no PR to label, so that issue is where they go.

### 2c. `seat.ps1` cannot declare a headless seat

**Do not declare your seat with `seat.ps1`.** It spawns a nested PowerShell the harness refuses, so a
headless session cannot run it. Your seat and goal live in the brief instead. The Stop hook still
records the episode.

This expires if `seat.ps1` gains a path that does not nest a shell, or the harness stops refusing
one. Test it by running the declare line once and reading the exit code.

### 2d. One grant decides whether you can spawn a session

Measured 2026-09-02 across six config roots. `.claude-account-1` carries `Bash(claude:*)` and
`PowerShell(claude:*)` in its allow list, and spawned a session end to end, exit 0 in 38.8 seconds.
The other five carry neither, and the classifier refuses them.

**Read your own config root before you assume either way.** Without the grant, every "brief a
Builder" in this file means write the brief, hand it to the Console, and let the owner start the
session.

[CONSOLE.md](CONSOLE.md) carries the same measurement in its header. A correction to one belongs in
both.

---

## 3. You get one turn, so pre-register the reading before you trigger the run

Your process ends when you return your four lines. A CI run outlives you. **You never read the result
of a run you trigger.**

### 3a. Five checks stand between a red and the word "flake"

These come from [LANDER.md](LANDER.md), *Attribution -- proving a CI failure is not the change's*.
There the two most famous "flakes" turned out to be a livelock and a test that was right.

| Check | What it settles |
|---|---|
| 1. Did a superset of this content pass the same leg? | A subset cannot introduce a failure the superset did not have. **With a superset run in hand, nothing else is needed.** |
| 2. What did the other concurrent runs do? | Runner contention is the obvious hypothesis. It was wrong once: two other runs passed the same leg in the same window. |
| 3. Is the change in the blast radius? | `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD \| grep -iE '<subsystem>'`, intersected against the failing test's imports and subprocesses. That same LANDER section binds **both verdicts**: an empty intersection exonerates; a non-empty one condemns and stops the re-run, even if the PR never touched that test. |
| 3, and the trap inside it | **Print the `<subsystem>` pattern beside a zero.** You chose that pattern, so an empty result is a fact about your spelling first. LANDER records one blast radius reported as 13 against a real 4. |
| 4. Is the leg chronically red? | `gh run list --workflow ci.yml --limit 25`. |
| 5. Did the retry harness decline? | `not a native crash -- not retrying` means nothing was papered over. That is the exact string, double hyphen included. |

### 3b. Some tests must never be re-run past

Measured 2026-08-26: `connscale` is a genuine flake at 19 percent per run, while `tooling_partition`
and `licence_header_gate` are deterministic.

**If you cannot name what failed, you are not entitled to re-run it.** A green re-run on the
identical commit is consistent with a real defect, not evidence against one.

These three classifications expire when somebody re-measures them. Cite the 2026-08-26 measurement
by date, so a reader can see how old it is.

### 3c. Split a re-run across two Regulators

**Write down what each outcome will mean before you trigger the run.** A re-run decided afterwards is
not a test. Explanation and evidence arrive together, so any outcome fits any story.

1. Write the discriminator. **Two failures unlike each other are evidence of flakiness. Two identical
   ones are evidence against it.** That is the one usually worth pre-registering.
2. Post it as a comment on the PR, before you trigger anything. The result lands in the same place, so
   the two sit side by side.
3. Trigger the run.
4. Return `NEXT: keep polling` and exit. **Do not wait on the runner.** A session that waits burns the
   seat and reads nothing.

### 3d. Honour a predecessor's pre-registration even when you think it is wrong

Measured on PR 641, 2026-08-27: a seat pre-registered "the same test failing twice means stop", the
same test failed twice, and it dequeued rather than re-ran. **The discriminator was wrong** and cost
one rebase and two queue cycles.

The log records it anyway. A rule obeyed only when it agrees with you is not a rule. Say on the row
that you think it was wrong, and still honour it.

### 3e. Census a recurring red by node id, never by assertion text

One test wearing two assertions reads as two unrelated bugs. Record the magnitude too: one occurrence
lost 1 of 36 messages and another lost 17 of 36, which are not one event under one name.

---

## 4. A commit that cannot reach the code separates `main`'s red from the PR's

A failure on a commit that cannot reach the code under test is not a property of the tree.

### 4a. The passive arm and the manufactured arm buy the same evidence at different prices

| Arm | How | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Passive | Search the leg's recent history for a commit that cannot reach the code and failed anyway. | Free, one `gh run list`. **Reach for this first.** |
| Manufactured | Push a null-change commit. | A runner cycle, plus the cost in *A manufactured arm restarts the PR's checks*. The only route when the history holds nothing suitable. |

**Prefer a throwaway branch off the same base** wherever the control does not need the PR's own head.
It buys the same evidence for the same runner cycle and leaves the PR's own checks standing.

**Say which arm you used.** A reader cannot tell them apart from the verdict alone.

**The one-turn rule holds either way.** You trigger the arm, post what each outcome will mean, and
hand the reading to your successor.

**CI on the PR tree is the authority, not a local run.** A green local quartet and a red one have both
turned out to be venv artifacts on the same commits.

### 4b. A manufactured arm restarts the PR's checks

A push to the PR branch fires `synchronize`. Every check result on the old head stops counting, and
the PR waits on a fresh run. That is the standing cost of the manufactured arm, and it is why 4a says
prefer a throwaway branch wherever the control does not need the PR's own head.

**RETIRED 2026-09-04: this section used to charge a second cost, and it told you to act on it.** It
said the push made `review-gate.yml` strip the `reviewed` label, and that the required context `a
reviewer has read this` then went red. Your verdict comment had to name the PR you un-reviewed.

**Measured 2026-09-04 on the engine's `main`: that context is not in the required set.** So the strip
no longer blocks anything, and the hand-off it asked for is a turn spent on a check that will never
answer.

**Half of it is still live, so do not read this as "the label is gone".** `review-gate.yml` is still
in the engine and still strips `reviewed` on a push. The label still disappears. What changed is that
nothing required reads it.

**This says nothing about the Reviewer seat**, which outlives its gate or does not on an owner
ruling. Reading a diff was never the gate's to authorise.

### 4c. Never write a required-context count

The engine's required set drifts. Readings inside one week: the failure log carries 13, 15 and 16, and
REVIEWER measured 14 on the server 2026-08-31. **Read it fresh every time.**

**It moved again on 2026-09-04.** `a reviewer has read this` was in the set on 2026-08-31 and was not
when this was written. That is the rule firing, not an exception to it. Read the set, not this line:

```
gh api repos/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/branches/main/protection --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts[]'
```

The vault is a separate repository with two required checks and `enforce_admins` false, so nothing
here transfers to it.

This prohibition expires only if the set is frozen and a workflow publishes it. Until then, a count in
prose is stale the day after you write it.

---

## 5. The queue ejects silently, and two commands answer different halves of it

`main` uses a GitHub merge queue. An ejected PR stays **open**, stays **mergeable**, and simply does
not merge. No field reports it.

**The clean case is PR 640.** LANDER records it evicted when 653 merged, still open and mergeable, with
nothing reporting it.

**Do not repeat the 626 and 627 reading.** A seat reported both as "green on all 15 required contexts
and were evicted anyway", broadcast it to seven mailboxes, and three seats repeated it back.

The row for those two in `docs/CI-FAILURE-LOG.md` corrects it, verdict `instrument`. They were green
on their PR **heads** and red on their **queue branches** -- separate shas, separate run sets. Their
21:39 row is `infra`, an Ubuntu mirror `apt-get` failure on the queue branch.

### 5a. Two commands answer different halves, and `autoMergeRequest` answers neither

Membership, position and state:

```
gh api graphql -f query='query{repository(owner:"MEFORORG",name:"MessageFoundry"){
  mergeQueue(branch:"main"){entries(first:20){totalCount nodes{position state
  pullRequest{number title}}}}}}'
```

Whether the queue branch itself went red:

```
gh run list --event merge_group
```

That second command is the log's own prescribed remedy: **check it before calling a PR landable.**

| Instrument | How it lies |
|---|---|
| `autoMergeRequest` | Under a merge queue it returns `null` on a PR that is genuinely enqueued. A count of armed PRs read that way reports zero while the queue moves. |
| `mergeQueue: null` | A repository with no queue returns this. That is a different null and must not be read as "queue empty". |
| An ejection itself | An ejection is a **state, not a cause**. Log the cause that ejected it, or `unestablished`. |

### 5b. A PR's state is a join over two clocks, and one lies by omission

**It was three until 2026-09-04.** The `reviewed` label was the middle clock. It still gets stripped
on a push, but no required context reads it, so it no longer moves a PR's state. Two clocks now.

| Clock | What it hides |
|---|---|
| `mergeStateStatus` | It reports `BEHIND` or `DIRTY` in preference to `BLOCKED`, so a block stays invisible on a stale branch. |
| The runs | These settle it. Take the newest completed run per context name and check the sha it ran on against the PR's current head. An older sha means stale, whatever the check says. |

**A required context with no completed run on the current head is unknown, not green.** Keep polling,
and never inherit the last verdict.

The demoted clock left a lesson worth more than the gate was. A label a workflow strips is trustworthy
only once that workflow's RUN has executed -- not when your own command returns. While the run sat
queued the label read present and was already wrong.

Expect that shape from any check that invalidates on an event: **the event is the gate's run, not your
command returning.** Wait for the run, then read the result back.

---

## 6. Write the log row for a reader who knows nothing, because that is who reads it

Add a row when you **diagnose** a failure, not when you see one. A red with no cause established is a
task, not a row. Newest row at the top.

### 6a. The verdict vocabulary is fixed in the file, and `main`'s own red has no entry

The vocabulary is `pr-defect`, `pr-ordering`, `flake`, `infra`, `gate-artifact`, `instrument`,
`advisory-noise`. **If none fits, define the new one in the file before using it.** An undefined
category is how two readers reach opposite conclusions from one row and neither notices.

**`main`'s own red has no verdict in that list.** Define one rather than stretching `infra` over it.
That gap closes the day somebody adds the definition, so check the file rather than trusting this
line.

`unestablished` is not a verdict there. It goes in the cause column, and the file says do not guess.

**`instrument` covers CI being right and a person reading it wrong, and those rows matter most.** A
misread leaves no artifact: a confident wrong conclusion, and nothing red to find later.

### 6b. A usable row carries six things

Less than this and the next Regulator redoes your triage from zero.

| Field | Why it is there |
|---|---|
| The head SHA you measured, plus run id and attempt number | Without the sha the row cannot be re-checked. |
| The context name exactly as GitHub spells it, and the pytest node id | *Census a recurring red by node id* says why: the node id is the identity, the assertion text is not. |
| The magnitude of the failure | "It failed" and "it lost 17 of 36 messages" are different findings. |
| The discriminator you pre-registered | Written before the run, with the run left unread. |
| Which control arm you used, passive or manufactured, and the verdict you reached | A reader cannot tell the arms apart from the verdict alone. |
| What you did not establish | Name the absence, because **silence reads as coverage**. |

### 6c. Land the row through the vault, then hand the PR to the Lander

Branch in the vault worktree your brief names, commit the row, push, and open the PR.

Then hand the PR to the Lander and say it is a tail-append to a table. The Lander decides what enters
the queue and in what order. A second open log PR is its problem to sequence, not yours.

### 6d. Correct a wrong row in place; never add a second

Say on the row that you corrected it. A log holding both a wrong answer and a right one, without
saying which is which, is worse than either alone.

**Rows are observation-selected**, so a count from this file counts logged failures, not failures that
happened. Any trend you draw names its window and says the sample is selected.

---

## 7. Post your four lines on the PR, because your stdout reaches nobody

Your process exits and the Console has no inbound channel. It polls. So put the verdict where it
already looks.

```
gh pr comment <N> --body-file <file>
```

When the red has no PR behind it, comment on the standing issue instead: `Reds with no pull request
behind them`. Then return the same four lines to whoever started you.

```
PR:       <number> at <head sha>
VERDICT:  pr-defect | main | flake | queue | unestablished
EVIDENCE: <the one measurement that settled it, plus the log row date>
NEXT:     brief a Builder | wait on main | re-run <context> | hand to the Lander | keep polling
```

| Verdict | What the line must carry |
|---|---|
| `pr-defect` | **Name the file and the assertion.** The Console writes a disposable brief from your line, and that Builder starts with no memory either. "Tests failed" makes it repeat your whole pass. |
| Anything else | **Say what would change the answer**, or the next Regulator inherits a verdict it cannot audit. |
| Any re-run you triggered | Report it, and link the comment where you pre-registered its reading. A reading fixed after the result is not evidence, and nothing downstream can tell. |

---

## 8. You fix nothing, merge nothing, enqueue nothing, and file no numbers

| Act | Who does it, and why not you |
|---|---|
| Fixing | A Builder fixes. You write the brief; the owner or the Console starts the session -- see the spawn-grant row in the standing rules. |
| Enqueueing and merging | The Lander decides what enters the queue and in what order, and merges on a standing grant. |
| The merge-forward | `main` has `strict: true`, so every open PR goes stale each time `main` moves. Nothing automates the update. The Lander does it. |
| A PR that needs a ruling rather than work | Hand it to the Lander, which takes it to the owner. |
| The ledger | A `#N` you want filed routes through the Console. **Never allocate one yourself.** |
| Raising `step_timeout` | It sits under `job_timeout` on purpose, so a deadlock below pytest surfaces as a step failure. Raising it trades a diagnostic for a green tick. |

**RETIRED 2026-09-04: a `reviewed` label row sat in this table**, saying any seat may apply it but
that doing so claims someone read the diff. The label still exists; no required context reads it, so
applying it gates nothing -- see *A manufactured arm restarts the PR's checks*.

Every row here expires the same way: on an owner ruling that widens this seat, stated in the owner's
own words and dated. A peer relaying a grant is not that ruling.

### 8a. The earlier edition said you do not write briefs, and three other passages say you do

Kept rather than deleted, because the wrong half is short and a reader who remembers it needs to see
it named.

| Version | What it said |
|---|---|
| The minority reading | "You attribute, you unblock what you can, and you file. **You do not write briefs** and you do not build." |
| The majority reading | The six-owner table sends a PR's red to "a brief for the next Builder". The spawn-grant row says "write the brief and hand it to the Console". The Fixing row says "you write the brief". |

**Follow the majority reading: you write the brief, and somebody else runs the session.** The
minority sentence is best read as forbidding you to build, which the Fixing row already covers. If a
Regulator ever needs the stricter reading, that is an owner question, not one a seat settles.

---

## 9. The role file holds only what never expires; a dated episode note holds live state

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| What goes in the EPISODE note, never here | The reds outstanding right now, open PR numbers, queue positions and membership, which branches are held, who is blocked on whom, "pick up here" lists, open item numbers, and anything with a session name in it. |
| What goes HERE | A lesson still true after the red clears: a trap, an instrument that lies, an ordering rule, a boundary of a gate, a measured mechanism. |
| Why the split is load-bearing | A mixed document decays into a TRUSTED document that is WRONG, and the durable half hides it. |
| State it once | State a load-bearing fact once and link to it. A fact restated in three places is corrected in one. |
| Every prohibition carries its expiry | Write beside it what would have to become true for it to stop being right, and how to check. A prohibition without one becomes permanent by default. |
| Retract in place | Keep the wrong version and why it was wrong. Delete the error and the next session re-derives it. The 626 and 627 reading under *The queue ejects silently* is kept for exactly that reason. |
| Your handoff is the log row, not a note | You get one turn, so the row in `docs/CI-FAILURE-LOG.md` and the PR comment ARE your handoff. Anything that does not fit either belongs in an episode note the Console can read. |
| Tone | The useful sentence is the measured one, not the alarming one. The cost of being wrong scales with how good the sentence sounds. |
